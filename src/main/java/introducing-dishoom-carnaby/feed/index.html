		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mital,

Sorry for the late reply, I do hope you were well looked after when you visited. Dishoom Carnaby is all on one floor and we have a disabled loo on the ground floor, which your friend could have used to save him going downstairs to the bathrooms.

Thanks,

Ginny]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi 

I have booked brunch for this saturday, however one of the guests is on crutches and struggles to go up and down stairs. Please could we have a table that is on the ground floor. Please could you also let me know whether there are stairs to access the restaurant too? 

Thank you
