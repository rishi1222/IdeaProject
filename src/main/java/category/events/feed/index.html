				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Our research for <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/introducing-dishoom-carnaby/">Dishoom Carnaby</a> took us down many unexpected avenues. We started to investigate the world of rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll Bombay in the &#8217;60s and made lots of new friends. Nissim Ezekiel, of <a href="http://thecombustiblesband.com">The Combustibles</a>, is one such friend. While we were putting together the restaurant and the <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/music/">Slip-Disc LP</a>, he kindly shared much memorabilia of the &#8216;groovy scene&#8217; in Bombay in the 60s and has now been kind enough to share his <a href="http://www.thecombustiblesband.com/2015/12/the-combustibles-on-dishooms-wall-of-fame-in-london/">blog</a> from The Combustibles&#8217; own website. </em></p>
<p>Dishoom – London’s extremely popular and highly regarded chain of restaurants modeled on the fast-vanishing Irani cafes of Bombay – opened its newest location on Kingly Street in Carnaby on October 14, 2015. As its owners explain: “When we began thinking about Dishoom Carnaby, we came across a surprising relationship that flourished in the 60s, when Western influences kicked off a rocking music scene in Bombay. We were drawn in by this cul-de-sac of history and contacted Sidharth Bhatia, author of the book ‘India Psychedelic’ as well as many of the musicians of the time.” The Combustibles are proud to have been part of this project and thrilled to have a number of the band’s images appear on Dishoom Carnaby’s Wall of Fame as we call it!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44323" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/040.jpg" alt="040" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Everett (and wife Valerie) and Lionel (with sister Ellen) attended the opening party for Dishoom Carnaby and thoroughly enjoyed being treated like celebrities again after a somewhat short hiatus of four decades or more! Enjoyed sharing the limelight with Reynold D’Silva – formerly with Brief Encounter in Bombay and now Founder/CEO of Silva Screen Records (London)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44324" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/041.jpg" alt="041" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Autograph time again??</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Ellen was always an integral part of The Combustibles experience in the good olde days – with a strong claim to have come up with the band’s name! Now, she’s again a part of the celebration in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-44329" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8V7A7421-copy.jpg" alt="8V7A7421 copy" width="682" height="478" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Bombay’s venerable Shanmukhanda Hall was the scene of many a “beat show” in the 60s and 70s including hosting the finals of the famous Simla Beat Contests. Here it’s time for “Kohinoor Beat Nite” sponsored by one of the city’s then leading textile companies. Velvette Fogg – then featuring Nissim’s cousin Nandu Bhende on vocals and brother David on bass – are also on the bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44326" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_3530.png" alt="IMG_3530" width="540" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Not having been in Bombay during the band’s heyday, Valerie now experiences Everett’s celebrity status in London!</p>
<p>For those of our fans and friends who get the opportunity please do visit Dishoom Carnaby, enjoy the incredible food and get some photos alongside some of The Combustibles images on the ‘Wall of Fame.’ Remember to send them to us at <a href="mailto:info@thecombustiblesband.com">info@thecombustiblesband.com</a> and we’ll put them on the site!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A celebration of brotherhood]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the window of Dishoom King’s Cross, we painted the iconic and resounding words of the great Rabindranath Tagore:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;<br />
Where knowledge is free;<br />
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow<br />
domestic walls;<br />
Where words come out from the depth of the truth;<br />
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;<br />
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary<br />
desert sand of dead habit;<br />
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action<br />
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.</em></p>
<p>Tagore was a true visionary. He saw it as deeply important that people live freely and harmoniously and that they set aside those prejudices that have the power to divide people and even nations. And on 16<sup>th </sup>October 1905 Tagore peacefully put these beliefs into action.</p>
<p>On this date, the British Empire broke up Tagore&#8217;s beloved Bengal on the basis of religion. In one move, the make-up of a nation would be changed, its people pulled up by the roots and displaced to foreign soil. But rather than accept his country being torn in two, Tagore felt compelled to make a stand for unity. He sought to inspire love, respect and a vow of mutual protection between Hindus and Muslims and so invoked the spirit of <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/raksha-bandhan-the-sacred-bond/">Raksha Bandhan</a>, which in Sanskrit means &#8220;the knot of protection&#8221;. Though it is traditionally celebrated between brothers and sisters, Tagore saw an opportunity to extend the meaning of the festival to bring together the people of Bengal. And so he called for the whole community to show their solidarity. Hindus and Muslims took to the streets in peaceful protest, and tied <em>rakhis</em> (the cotton threads that symbolise love and protection) on one another. The statement was clear: <strong>Do not divide us. We are all brothers and sisters here. </strong></p>
<p>Through this humble gesture they showed that they were united as a community, and on that day in 1905, the tying of the rahki became a symbol of brotherhood, of humanity, of peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>These days those events are largely forgotten, eclipsed by the turmoil of later years. We Hindus enjoy Raksha Bandhan as a celebration of the <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/raksha-bandhan-the-sacred-bond/">precious bond between brother and sister</a>. We&#8217;re very fond indeed of this little festival and the way it brings our families together every year to remind us of the ties that bind us.</p>
<p>And yet our minds often snag on Tagore&#8217;s poem. We share his vision – our world should not be broken into fragments by narrow domestic walls of race, caste, religion or any other marks of difference. And a celebration such as <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-the-festival-of-light/">Diwali</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/eid/">Eid</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/">Holi</a> or Raksha Bandhan is a great source of joy and, as such, should be shared freely. And so, this Raksha Bandhan, we invite everyone &#8211; all humans, not just our Hindu brother-and-sister pairs &#8211; to celebrate this lovely, gentle festival with us.</p>
<p>This year, Raksha Bandhan will fall on Saturday 29<sup>th</sup> August (depending on the moon!). On this day, we will be gifting you all a rakhi or two, to tie on whomever you choose as a symbol of your love and friendship. It could be a sibling, a friend, a neighbour, or even a stranger – it should be anyone you want to share a little happiness and goodwill with! (There&#8217;ll also be mithai for everyone, and the requisite materials for anyone wishing to do a little pooja with us &#8211; just ask!)</p>
<p>Wishing you all a very happy Raksha Bandhan!</p>
<p><em>Please do note that Dishoom Covent Garden is closed until Monday 31st August, so Raksha Bandhan celebrations are only taking place at Dishoom Shoreditch and Dishoom King&#8217;s Cross.</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[A morning of mindfulness and gratitude]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On sunny Saturday 4<sup>th</sup> July 2015, The Crossing (inside the atrium of the Granary Building at King’s Cross) became an oasis of calm. 100 guests joined us to listen, stretch, relax and breathe their way through RISE – a unique event celebrating yoga, music and food.</p>
<p>We cannot express enough thanks and appreciation to <a href="http://www.claireyoga.com">Claire Missingham</a>, who led the yoga class with such joy and energy, and <a href="www.nitinsawhney.com">Nitin Sawhney</a> and his friends, who created such a beautiful ambience with their incredible music.</p>
<p>As guests entered The Crossing bright and early, they found 100 yoga mats laid out and the welcoming scent of incense and natural flowers infusing the air. Garlands and trees transformed the space into an oasis of calm and serenity. Soon, it would be holding the energy of 100 yogis, brought together by their love of yoga, music and food.</p>
<p>The event was open to all levels. Whether you were completely new to the mat, or had been practicing complicated inversions since forever – it didn’t matter. It was so wonderful to see and watch so many people coming together to listen and learn and practice as one.</p>
<p>For 90 minutes, 100 individuals all shared one singular state of consciousness. As the first notes of music gently floated into the morning air, you could feel their energies combine and the whole spirit of the event became awakening, uplifting and unifying. There are very few moments in life where 100 people are joined in movement. As the first flows of the sun salutation stretched everyone’s limbs, there was an invitation to leave the stresses and niggles of everyday life behind and instead, welcome in mindfulness and gratitude. We were mindful of the sun, of the mat, of the music, of the sweet smell of incense and gratitude flooded our bodies with every breath. All the senses were invited to awaken and be nourished by the beauty of the space and the music.</p>
<p>As Claire and her team of helpers skillfully guided all the guests through each asana, Nitin’s music provided a heavenly backdrop. Our bodies would be acutely aware of every movement and of every breath, while the mind was free to be nourished by the calmness and beauty of the music. It felt as if we were in another time and place. As the music finished, the class drew to an end and everyone was gently brought back into the present time and space. We then served a selection of delicious Homemade Granola, Chai and Fresh Juices to rejuvenate all the hungry yogis!</p>
<p>We were so excited that you all came and joined in with the natural serenity of the morning. Enormous thanks again to the uber-talented Claire and Nitin for helping us bring this unique event to life. We very much hope we&#8217;ll have the privilege to work with them again.</p>
<p>Namaste.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The ritual of Zakat]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Compassion. Generosity. Discipline. Honesty. Selflessness. Tolerance. These principles lie at the heart of Islam. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are bound to give, share and take care of others – whether those joined by family bonds or by friendship, or simply those less fortunate than themselves.</p>
<p>Faith doesn’t just mean believing in God – it means tangible actions and rituals, built around the Five Pillars of Islam. Carrying out these Pillars (<em>Iman</em>, serving god; <em>Salah</em>, prayer five times each day; <em>Sawm</em>, fasting during <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/ramadan/">Ramadan</a>; <em>Hajj</em>, making the pilgrimage to Mecca, and <em>Zakat</em>, charity) is the foundation of each day and is like a compass to guide one through life.</p>
<p>Thus, as a Muslim, charity is not just something to be carried out when the mood strikes you; it really is a lifelong duty. There are even rules on how much each person should donate from their earnings each year. Giving generously and regularly, and offering aid to those less fortunate – both within and outside the community – is part of the essence of Islam.</p>
<p>During Ramadan, this essence is alive more than ever. Alongside the rituals of prayer and fasting, giving is a natural element of this auspicious month. It is a time for sacrifice and self-discipline; and parting with hard-earned money for the benefit of others is a reminder that we are not defined by our possessions, but by our purpose.</p>
<p>Whether you are fasting or whether you are of a different faith, Ramadan is an opportunity to honour the universal values of love, giving and unity. In doing so, we just might remind ourselves that we all have much more in common than we think. In these troubled times of extremist madness and lazy scapegoating, such a celebration of our universal spirit seems good and right.</p>
<p>So – wishing you all Ramadan Mubarak! May your prayers and fasts be accepted.</p>
<p><em>During Ramadan, the month of giving, we are privileged to be supporting two wonderful charities: <a href="http://www.magicbreakfast.com/">Magic Breakfast</a>, in London, and <a href="http://www.akshayapatra.org/">Akshaya Patra</a>, in India. Both charities provide nourishing, free school meals for children who don’t get enough food at home. So, for every guest who eats with us this month, we’ll feed another two in need, meaning every meal we serve equals three full bellies.</em></p>
<p><em>Every evening at the time of breaking fast – which falls around 9.20pm – we’ll be serving the traditional dates and refreshing Nimbu Pani to anyone waiting outside for a table, to keep you going until dinner!</em></p>
<p><em>We’ll also be holding a special event to celebrate <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/eid-al-fitr/">Eid al-Fitr</a> – which marks the end of Ramadan – on Sunday 19th July – details coming soon…</em></p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE – AUGUST 2015</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We welcomed 81,034 of you during Ramadan, so we&#8217;ve made donations that mean that each charity can now serve the same number of breakfasts or lunches to children who would otherwise go hungry – a total of 162,068 meals.</strong></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[CHILLI GARLIC CRAB]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few hours of sun cast a pink hue over the Bombay sky. October lights dance across the bay. A veritable cocktail of spices floats in the air as noises from the nearby food stalls give visitors the promise of quick, hot and delicious food. It is a magical evening here on Chowpatty Beach.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to witness such a thing, especially during the Diwali season. All kinds of people from all over Bombay come to this spot, to snack and stroll. At this time of year all the clothes are just that bit more colourful. Young and old jumble together visiting their favourite spots for Pau Bhaji or Gola. Everybody eats outdoors and everyone shares in the moment.</p>
<p>The normal, frenetic pace of life that defines the city is forgotten on evenings like this. No matter how busy one’s day might have been, time spent at Chowpatty Beach reminds us to slow down and enjoy the company of loved ones, and that good food is never far away. We can always find the time to appreciate a particularly delicious Vada Pau, a rewardingly crunchy Bhel or a sweetly invigorating fresh sugarcane juice.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are times when we are granted more than just a moment to pause. Diwali, the festival of light, offers all of us a chance to stop, reflect and remember all that there is to be thankful for in the world. Amidst the celebrations of light, colour and the <a title="Diwali at Dishoom – 2011" href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-at-dishoom/">wonderful story</a>, and the constant crackle of fireworks, the whole family comes together to indulge in an abundance of delicious, traditional khana. From mithai to masala chai, every dish is served with love and care, and family, friends, and neighbours all share their delight in a joyful, communal pause.</p>
<p>We absolutely love Diwali. So, this year, we held a special event inside the Granary Building at King’s Cross (near our <a title="IN WHICH A YOUNG IRANI OPENS A CAFÉ IN A GODOWN BEHIND VICTORIA TERMINUS, C. 1928" href="http://www.dishoom.com/in-which-a-young-irani-opens-a-cafe-in-a-godown-behind-victoria-terminus-c-1928/">new café</a> – opening in a few weeks!). It was great fun &#8211; check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.985547848138363.1073741832.109165852443238&amp;type=1">photo album</a>. And in the Shoreditch and Covent Garden cafés, Chef Naved has devised two special Diwali dishes of Phaldari Kofta Ruby (veg) and Chilli Garlic Crab.</p>
<p>Naved has even kindly shared his own recipe for the Chilli Garlic Crab (below), so – if you can’t make it to in to see us &#8211; at least you can share in our celebrations at home!</p>
<h2>CHILLI GARLIC CRAB</h2>
<p>Whenever we go to Bombay, we stop in to Mahesh Lunch Home for some brilliant seafood – and they inspired us to create this dish.</p>
<p><em>Serves two, pretty generously</em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>300g fresh crab, off the shell</p>
<p>60g butter</p>
<p>40ml refined vegetable oil</p>
<p>A large knob of ginger, chopped</p>
<p>8-10 medium cloves garlic – be generous!</p>
<p>Pinch of chopped green chilli</p>
<p>Handful of chopped dill leaves</p>
<p>Generous handful of chopped coriander</p>
<p>6-8 whole spring onions, roughly chopped</p>
<p>20 black peppercorns, freshly crushed in a pestle and mortar, or in a teatowel with a rolling pin</p>
<p>Lime for squeezing</p>
<p>Salt – to taste</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<p>In a heavy-bottomed pan, gently heat the butter and oil together. Add the chopped garlic and sauté until golden brown.</p>
<p>Add the freshly crushed pepper, chopped ginger, and the chopped spring onion bulbs, and saute lightly for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Add the crab meat and sauté for 2-3 minutes, adding a little water if the crab begins to stick to the pan.</p>
<p>Add all of the remaining ingredients, including the green stems of and toss for for further 2 minutes. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lime and serve with Malabar paratha or soft pau (Bombay buns).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“DON’T LIMIT A CHILD TO YOUR OWN LEARNING, FOR SHE WAS BORN IN ANOTHER TIME.”  RABINDRANATH TAGORE]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A baking hot day in early August in Bombay, not too long ago. An old Irani gentleman and his granddaughter sit in the shade of his café, underneath the least erratic fan. The little girl turns to her grandfather with a quizzical look on her face, and asks him a question….</em></p>
<p>“Dada, what is an Indian?”</p>
<p>I pause. Blink. Clear my throat. What do I tell her? Which of the many possible answers should I give to that simple, innocent question?</p>
<p>I take a moment to think. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>She looks around the café, as if it’s obvious. “Well, everyone speaks different languages, people wear different clothes, and we all eat different food… but what makes us all Indian?”</p>
<p>Rather humbly, I realise that I can’t give her a quick answer. How do you sum up a nation of one billion people (and who knows how many gods) for a child?</p>
<p>Her curiosity, however, must be nurtured; her sense of wonder and openness preserved. I must think of an answer.</p>
<p>So, I talk. I begin by telling her of the many peoples that have shaped our landscape, of the rise and fall of emperors and empresses, the religions that have waxed and waned, of the laws that have been passed. I describe the influence of the British and how their control over India made us feel robbed of our freedom and basic rights. I speak of Bapu, the father of the nation, who taught us that strength and violence were not the same thing, and taught us the need to live in harmony with one another.</p>
<p>As I delve further and deeper into the influences on being Indian, I find myself sharing my own memories of the events that have shaped our history.</p>
<p>I recall the feelings of oppression and exploitation that many felt under the Britishers, and then the relief at independence. Then it was Prime Minister Pandit Nehru that gave voice to these feelings in his declaration on 14<sup>th</sup>August 1947:</p>
<p><em>“At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”</em></p>
<p>I remember feeling overwhelming emotion – we all did. It was a time of complete change. Together, we swept away British rule and ushered in a birth of the Indian nation.</p>
<p>But I shall forever remember this time in history for its lurches between hope and dark despair. As India and Pakistan were pulled asunder by the very movements that sought to create a nation, the forging of our identity became stained with blood. My eyes moisten as the memory of hearing the horrific stories of partition comes rushing back. I stop short of telling these to my granddaughter.</p>
<p>I must not let my memory taint her innocence – at least not today. If she is seeking an answer to the question: “What is an Indian?” then I think my answer should be this: an Indian is Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bihari and Tamil; he is Hindu, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Christian and Buddhist. We are all Indian and together we are India.</p>
<p>If the hope and despair of 1947 taught me something, it is that the Indian identity is all-encompassing, and that when we allow our differences to become prejudices, to become walls that divide us, distrust and violence accumulate and we undermine the very idea of India.</p>
<p>After all this talking-talking, I ask her, gently: “So, now, beti – what do you think Indian is?”</p>
<p>And she answered: “Dada, it is us and everyone else.”</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day.</p>
<p>Come in and see us today. We’ve managed to put together a special <a href="http://playlists.net/dishoom-republic-day">patriotic playlist</a> and we’d love to buy you a nice cold Thums Up when you wish us a happy Independence Day (before 6pm). Jai hind!</p>

<p>Holi’s great, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Cast your sins into the fire. Throw colours with random strangers, and random abandon. Laugh freely and joyously. Dance. Laugh again. Try to shake the colour out of your hair and try to beat the colour out of your clothes. Enjoy the sight of elderly grandparents, tiny children and everyone in between – all doing the same thing, all covered in glorious technicolour. Enjoy how surreal it is. Enjoy how magical it feels.</p>
<p>In our case, all in a big shed in Hackney. For all of you who were there, you’ll know how much fun it was. There was no actual <em>bhang</em> in our lassi, but everyone seemed as high as kites. People who had never met before were rubbing powder paint in one another&#8217;s faces, dancing and improvising a conga. And in a way, I think this is exactly what we need more of in London.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure; London is growing. Our city is getting busier and more crowded. We Londoners are forever moaning about accelerating property prices, and more flash sports cars seem to be racing pointlessly up and down Knightsbridge. And as the city grows, I’d like to think we can make sure that it’s truly a shared city. That all of us find ways to have fun together, to break down barriers, to leave aside differences and celebrate each others’ culture. Even if it’s only for a few short hours, it&#8217;s really important. A city that doesn’t do this becomes a nervous and divided city, full of suspicion; a sad dystopia. Let&#8217;s never let that happen to London.</p>
<p>So, in that spirit, we promise to keep throwing our Holi parties, if you’ll all keep coming!</p>
<p>Enjoy our little video of this year’s Holi, see the (massive) <a title="Mad Gallery" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.849356131757536.1073741829.109165852443238&amp;type=3" target="_blank">photo gallery</a> &#8211; tag yourself if you were there. And, most importantly of all, come next year!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Drink chai, smash cup, make great design. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In September 2013, at Dishoom Shoreditch, we’re hosting a ‘cabinet of curiosity’ curated by <i>This is Provenance</i> as part of the London Design Festival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our cabinet was once used for family heirlooms in India. Today, we’ll be exhibiting a series of illustrated plates which attempt to capture the memories of those who know and love the original Irani cafés of Bombay. These plates were created in collaboration with OgilvyOne and by gathering the stories of hundreds of people who have spent time in the Irani Cafés.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The stories are truly touching: one contributor remembers a poorer customer pouring their chai into a saucer to share it with a friend, another recalls the delight of her first taste of tutti-frutti ice-cream. Still more remember turning points in their lives – a revelation about one’s path in life, a coming of age – taking place in the shade of the cafés. Together, the plates represent the collective memories of those who ate, drank and lingered in these disappearing spaces. You can see the full range of plates <a href="http://platewallah.dishoom.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cabinet will also display work from two designers inspired by the subcontinent. London-based Jasleen Kaur will display her ingenious Tala Curry Measure, a tribute to how recipes are passed down through the generations in Indian families. Australian designer Sian Pascale, who lives and works in Bombay, will be exploring individuality and disposability with her contemporary interpretations of traditional earthenware chai cups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re proud to be part of Encounters with Provenance and the London Design Festival this year, and we’re inspired by the great designers working in Shoreditch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop by this week for a chai – we’d like to show you the treasures in our cabinet.</p>

		<title>The Celebration of Breaking Fast</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Eid al-Fitr is welcomed with great joy after a month of austerity. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The festival of Eid al-Fitr (literally &#8220;the Celebration of the Breaking of the Fast&#8221;) marks the conclusion of <a title="Ramadan" href="http://dishoom.com/ramadan/">Ramadan</a>, the Islamic holy month where restraint and discipline must be practised. The rituals of Ramadan are a spiritual and a physical cleansing; the act of fasting cultivates the qualities of gratitude, generosity and empathy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But Ramadan is equally synonymous with feasting. <i>Iftar</i> – the meal with which Muslims break their fast – is an occasion for eating rich foods and indulging in the naughtiness of deep-fried snacks after a day of restraint. In Bombay, Ramadan means brisk business for purveyors of delicacies like meat-stuffed samosas, pakoras and brightly-coloured coils of <em>jalebi</em>. At the end of each day families gather around the table, and once the sun sets they can at last break their fast, a ritual which draws them together and renews their bonds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, Eid al-Fitr is declared upon the sighting of the new moon; the occasion is welcomed with joy after a month of austerity. The morning begins with communal prayer at the local mosque. Families proudly don their specially-made new clothes; children compare their finery. Girls show off henna patterns on their hands and the pretty bangles chosen to match their clothes. Families give money or gifts known as <em>Eidie</em> to children. And of course, there is food. Lots and lots of food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every family has its own traditions and specialities, treasured recipes handed down through the generations. Preparations start days in advance, each dish prepared with love and care. The tables at Eid luncheons groan under the weight of sumptuous rice dishes, aromatic with whole spices and studded with meat, <em>kormas</em> whose gravies are rich with cream or yoghurt, <em>nihari</em> (slow-cooked lamb in a silky gravy), roasted meats, vegetables and lentil dishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These feasts last for hours; returning for seconds, thirds and fourths, every family member is helpless to resist the draw of their favourite dish. And after a month of fasting, the joys of feasting in daylight cannot be curbed. Finally, once the platters are picked clean, the meal is concluded with an array of rich desserts like slow-simmered <em>kheer</em> (rice pudding) and <em>dhoodh</em> <em>seviyan</em> (a milky pudding of vermicelli) with a scattering of blanched almonds, perhaps anointed with silver leaf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the most celebrated delicacy eaten at Eid is Haleem, a rich traditional dish of lamb, cracked wheat and lentils, cooked for many hours and pounded. The reverence in which Haleem is held brings the joy of Eid out of the home, into the community and beyond. It evolved from the Middle Eastern dish Harees, a thick savoury porridge; Harees became Haleem thanks to the influence of Aga Hussain Zabed, owner of the Madina Hotel in Hyderabad and a member of the same Irani community which founded the <a title="A BOMBAY CAFÉ IN LONDON" href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-story/a-bombay-cafe-in-london/">legendary cafés</a> in Bombay. As the popularity of the Haleem grew, the Hyderabadi chefs most skilled at preparing it gained national reputations, and spread their speciality across the country. Today, it is famed across India for its rich flavour; the complex cooking process means it is usually enjoyed at feasts and celebrations – and especially at Eid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am always struck by the comforting unity of Eid customs – the gathering of family, the new clothes, the giving of gifts, the generosity of spirit and of course, the plentiful food. The devotion with which families prepare each <i>Iftar</i> feast, the care taken on each sumptuous dish for the Eid table, the extra <i>jalebi</i> sneaked onto the plate however much you protest that you’re full – these are all tangible expressions of love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And at its heart, Eid truly is a celebration of love, and of togetherness. This Eid, as every other, I am looking forward to celebrating at home with my family and most beloved friends, and preparing a grand feast for them. Food is love. Both must be given freely.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">*<em>The below information refers to our 2013 events &#8211; for information on this year&#8217;s celebrations, <a title="Ramadan and Eid at Dishoom" href="http://www.dishoom.com/ramadan-eid/">click here</a></em>*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the spirit of the celebration, we’re serving a <strong>special Eid feast</strong> – featuring Haleem – from <strong>Wednesday 7th August</strong> (when Eid is likely to begin – depending on the moon’s sighting, of course).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And on <strong>Sunday 11th August</strong> (2pm-4pm), we invite you to come and celebrate Eid with us at Dishoom Shoreditch. There&#8217;ll be a storytelling by Shamim Azad, plenty of Mithai, <em>mehndi</em> (henna), Carrom, <em>meetha Paan</em> and lashings of Chai. We really hope you can make it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, we wish Ramadan Kareem to all our Muslim brothers and sisters. May your prayers and fasts be accepted, and may the blessings you receive fill your life with happiness and open all the doors to success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(During Ramadan we&#8217;re serving Nihari as a special, and we’ll have some dates available every day to break your fast – just ask!)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[HOLI – THE INDIAN FESTIVAL OF COLOUR – BRINGS US ALL TOGETHER]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jOsYEW7qrk8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We held a proper Holi party at Village Underground in Shoreditch on Sunday 24th March 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a glorious, exuberant, colourful, joy-filled mess. Everyone from the tiniest little children to the most elderly aunty-jis had a fantastic time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over 300 of you showed up to our (sold-out!) party to see our master storyteller Vayu Naidu weave her magic. She told us how Holi breaks down barriers and brings people together, regardless of background, religion or social status. At its heart, this lovely, barmy festival is a chance to forgive past transgressions and extend the hand of peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then the moment arrived – and we released almost 70kg of gulal (coloured powder) into the waiting crowd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It went a little wild. We danced, and threw powder, and burst balloons full of <em>gulal</em> over each others&#8217; heads, and chuckled at how barmy we all looked. It was magical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Watch the video, and see for yourself. And if you like the look of our Holi party – do come and <a href="http://dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/">celebrate with us in 2014.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HAPPY HOLI!</strong></p>
