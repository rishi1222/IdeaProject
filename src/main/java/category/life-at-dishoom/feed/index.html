		<description><![CDATA[Back here in the Permit Room again. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again, dear reader, I’m back here. I am the weary, be-stubbled regular propping up one end of the bar in the Permit Room at the same time every year. I have a burra peg of something stiff at my elbow. If they&#8217;d let you smoke in here, I&#8217;d be making my way slowly through the pack. It&#8217;s been a long year. I feel depleted and consumed. Nothing left in the tank.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve begun to make friends with 2015. Fifteen, you old bastard. You truly were the best of times and the worst of times. For myriad reasons, you brought with you twelve of the toughest, fullest months. Weeks that were hard, and days that could only be dealt with one at a time. And yet, sitting here on the threshold of one year and the next, sorting through the events in my head, I&#8217;m beginning to discern the lessons you were teaching.</p>
<p>We lost a family member this year. A life made unfairly, senselessly short, the grief hard. But we also experienced the smiling kindness and cheerfully unshakeable courage of someone dealing with unspeakable pain. The strength and resilience of children, the unyielding love of family. The echoes that she leaves behind sound like gentle laughter, they sound like a love of life. The twinkle in her eye somehow outlasts the tears in ours. It is humbling; cached within the intense sadness of passing, there are precious – and joyful – lessons on how to live.</p>
<p>Of course,’15 carried with it other less intense moods too, for which I’m grateful. In Dishoom’s world, you, dear patron, continued to allow us to look after you, leaving with your wallet slightly lighter and your stomach slightly heavier than when you arrived; and perhaps with your spirit a touch refreshed. You let us serve you in this way and we give you sincere, humble and heartfelt thanks; for this is our livelihood.</p>
<p>In ’15, we launched a fourth Dishoom, on Kingly Street. This time our imagination wandered into the 1960s; we became the <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/introducing-dishoom-carnaby/" target="_blank">handsome young Irani in London</a>, returning to Bombay on hearing news of his father’s passing. The result was Dishoom Carnaby in which we explored Bombay of the period, so rich in its architectural and cultural detail. We sought out and made friends with the (actual, and lovely) people our handsome Irani would have known had he been a real person. Stalwarts such as Farrukh, Dolly, Padmini, Reynold, Nissim and, of course, the indomitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha_Puthli" target="_blank">Asha</a> became a part of our life. (Asha, by the way, is a living legend who can refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" target="_blank">Andy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger" target="_blank">Mick</a> by their first names.)</p>
<p>We also discovered that when the music of the Beatles and the Stones snuck past the walls of conservative Bombay in the sixties, kids picked up their guitars and started calling themselves ‘Beat’ bands. At the same time British groups were exploring mystic exotic India and her musical (and chemical!) delights. We became interested (obsessed) with this scene and, consulting with our new friend Sidharth Bhatia and our old friend Rob Wood, we actually managed to release an album, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/music/slip-disc/" target="_blank">Slip-Disc: Dishoom’s Bombay London Grooves</a>. Our hearts were lifted when Mojo gave our album 4 stars, Uncut rated it 8/10 and the good people over at BBC radio kept talking about it and playing it. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts for lending your ears to listen to the result of our (mis)adventures!</p>
<p>Beyond the boundaries of Dishoom, though, the world had a slightly disturbing quality. We’ve previously written in these pages of our strong belief in the need to create shared spaces, to break down barriers, to celebrate difference rather than judge it. More than ever, though, it seems that the worst are full of passionate intensity and that the best lack conviction. The moronic and lethal prejudices of extremists (whether Daesh or Donald) provide the warlike drumbeat to which events seem bound to dance. Reasonable and kind voices are at risk of being drowned out by the intolerant din.</p>
<p>One thing that Daesh, Donald and their kind have in common is that they see the world as binary. Us and them. Black and white. They thrive on polarity and conflict. Daesh talks often about the ‘<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/20/isis-binary-struggle-grey-zone-jihadism" target="_blank">grey zone</a>’. This grey zone is a place in which Muslims and non-Muslims co-exist peacefully. For Daesh it’s anathema.</p>
<p>I, for one, whole-heartedly want to live in the grey zone, where we all rub up against each other. It’s a messy shared space, to be sure, but it’s colourful and joyous. The way to fight extremism, or to react to the tragic nihilistic attacks in Paris (and elsewhere, for that matter) is not to shrink or dilute the grey zone, as Donald, Marine and others would have us do, but to celebrate it, defend it, and indeed to deepen it and expand it.</p>
<p>As you may have figured out, we work pretty hard to make Dishoom a first-class grey zone. Irani Cafés were quite possibly the original Bombay grey zones. We’re not able to fix things outside our walls but we can make sure that within our walls, the world is as it should be. In Dishoom, we really like serving food cooked in Parsi, Muslim, Hindu and Christian traditions, and we do it deliberately and self-consciously. We like celebrating <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/" target="_blank">Holi</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/eid-al-fitr/" target="_blank">Eid</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-and-ramayana/" target="_blank">Diwali</a> and Christmas. We have a strong view that mixing it up is a Good Thing. There is truly no greater pleasure than in bringing people together to celebrate each other’s cultures. I can’t think of a single reason not to do this. In fact, I’d go further; in today’s political climate, we must all do this. I think we’d be barmy not to.</p>
<p>One of the best things we’ve ever done at Dishoom had its origins in June this year. A group of us were sitting around a table replete with food (which is, as you can imagine, not an uncommon event at Dishoom). We were discussing Ramadan. Our group was composed of Hindus, a less-than-conscientious Christian, a Muslim and an aspiring Buddhist. Most of us had known that charity was one of the foundations of Islam, but we learnt that the holy time of Ramadan is particularly associated with giving to those less fortunate than yourself. Our food-laden table was beautiful, but in that context it gave us pause for thought. We decided that our ‘zakat’ (or charity) for the month of Ramadan would be to feed two children in need for every meal we served. We put this into place and worked with the delightful people at Magic Breakfast and Akshaya Patra – and in the end we were able to donate funds for <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/ramadan-the-month-of-giving/" target="_blank">160,000 meals</a> to be fed to children who would otherwise go hungry.</p>
<p>A short time later, we were discussing Diwali and the Hindu new year, which is a very special time for us Hindus. Again, we discussed that we should surely be contributing to the wider world (our ever-replete table being a reliable reminder of our good fortune). Someone came up with the idea that we should, from Diwali, make our Ramadan ‘zakat’ a permanent feature of what we do at Dishoom. It just made sense. It’s surely a tragedy that in our world children still go hungry. So, from this Diwali, we pledged to feed a hungry child for each guest we serve at Dishoom.</p>
<p>I’m prouder of this than almost anything else that I’ve been involved in. So far this year, we’ve donated over a quarter of a million meals for children in India and in East London. As I think back to how we as a group were moved to do this, it feels right; Hindus, Christians, Muslims and others feeding needy children in the name of Islam for Ramadan and then making this a permanent part of Dishoom from the Hindu new year.</p>
<p>So ’15 you old bastard, my burra peg is almost drained dry. Writing your elegy is helping me to come to terms with your despair and your hope, your weeping and your laughter. I’ve blinked back a few tears, but I’m smiling.</p>
<p>I know beyond all doubt that our ’15 here at Dishoom was full to the brim with good people, without whom we’d be nothing at all. I’m proud to be part of this; to each and every person in the Dishoom team, I want to give the warmest, sincerest thank you that I am able to summon. To every one of our kind and gracious suppliers, I give deep thanks; it’s good to be working with you. We’re also utterly grateful for the bottomless and loving patience of our families. And in the end, it is you, kind and good patrons of our livelihood, who breathe life into our work and allow us to do what we do. Thank you and thank you again for coming to Dishoom, allowing us to serve you, and coming back for more.</p>
<p>Well, it’s time for me to go home to celebrate Christmas, like a good Hindu. This year, my four year old daughter is very interested in baby Jesus and has been asking me whether he’s like baby Krishna. I’m sure I’ll figure it out by the time I get home.</p>
<p>From all of us here at Dishoom, we wish you the best for Christmas and the New Year. And from the bottom of all our hearts, we wish you the very best for ’16. It probably won’t be an easy year, but we hope it’s a good year.</p>
<p>May Ganesh-ji give you the strength to deal with the tears and the openness to make the most of the joy.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A labour of love and music]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Rob Wood, Creative Director and Founder of <a href="http://www.musicconcierge.co.uk">Music Concierge</a> has been helping us curate and evolve the Dishoom musical identity since Covent Garden first opened in 2010. Six years on, he has now helped us to compile and bring together the groovy vinyl that is Slip-Disc: Dishoom&#8217;s Bombay London Grooves. Here he has kindly penned a few words on Dishoom, his love of music and the legend that is Asha Puthli!</em></p>
<p>Personally I have always loved piecing together music. Segue-ing tracks or styles together, or juxtaposing different sounds to create something that feels exciting, or surprising. I started doing it in my early teens. Like thousands of other music fans I would stay awake listening to John Peel under the duvet covers, away from the eyes and ears of my parents, recording new releases by The Fall, The Smiths, Kraftwerk or Orange Juice on to cassette tape. I graduated on to making tapes for my mates’ parties and as tokens of appreciation to girlfriends, before organically falling into DJing just as acid house arrived. I’ve been doing it ever since and have been lucky enough to make a living out of curating music for record labels, and for the music magazines I worked at, and more recently for brands through the music agency I now run.</p>
<p>I’ve worked with Dishoom since its birth. Co-founder Shamil Thakrar had a very clear vision for the exotic and wonderful Irani café idea. It needed to feel like a café for sure, but like its design, its music needed to evoke its Bombay inspiration going back to the 1930s, and at the same time have a very unique Dishoom eye-twinkling twist. As a fellow music fan, Shamil was fun to work with and we had fun poring over various tracks and artists from cult ’70s Bollywood soundtracks, to jazz greats, to quirky niche micro-genres from the 1950s and ’60s.</p>
<p>As with all the immaculate attention to detail and little design touches that have been lovingly stitched into each Dishoom restaurant, the soundtrack we created seemed to find a place in people’s hearts which was very satisfying for everyone involved. As soon as he knew Dishoom would be opening a restaurant on Kingly Street in Soho, in spitting distance of Carnaby Street, Shamil was keen to put out a Dishoom compilation album. The Carnaby connection was too good to ignore. Thus we came up with the idea of <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/music/slip-disc/" target="_blank">Slip-Disc: Dishoom’s Bombay London Grooves</a>. Our first record release was to zip between the Bombay Beat scene of the ’60s and the peak of Swinging London, with some off-the-hook cult Dishoom tracks along the way. What’s more it was going to be released on vinyl.</p>
<p>Using the book ‘India Psychedelic’ by Sidharth Bhatia as a reference point, The Savages were a good place to start. Playing a key part in the then-tiny Indian rock scene, their cover of ‘Born To Be Wild’ captures the Bombay beat scene’s passion for the sounds coming out of the UK and US at the time.</p>
<p>The nephew of renowned musician Ravi Shankar, Ananda was also clearly “feeling the vibe, man”. He had after all been hanging out in California with Hendrix no less. His sitar and Moog drenched version of ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbVSFVOJnLU" target="_blank">Jumpin’ Jack Flash</a>’ is arguably one of the few Stones’ covers that betters the original. It was always going to be on this album.</p>
<p>But Slip-Disc was never going to be just a history lesson. Dishoom evokes the past to create something fresh. We weren’t interested in simply creating an historical document to the cross-pollination between two counter cultures. We wanted to add some essence of Dishoom. Hence The Bombay Royale’s blistering homage to Bollywood is included in all its Technicolor magic. BB Davis &amp; The Red Orchidstra bring a dark re-rub of Roy Budd’s seminal ‘Get Carter’ soundtrack. Most colourful of all is probably the song taken from the legendary Bollywood film Gumnaam: ‘Jaan Pehchan Ho’. Once seen and heard in context, it is an unforgettable Indian twist on the actual ‘60s themselves. The dance scene is one of the best on film, but for Shamil, me and my team, the music was one of the key inspirations when we first put our heads together in 2009. If Dishoom had a soundtrack, this would be it.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyEnG_DEB1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I have been asked to pick a favourite. It would have to be Asha Puthli’s contribution on the Peter Ivers Group’s ‘Ain’t That Peculiar’. We knew we wanted her on there, but we ummed and ahhed about which track. Many of her tracks that I love best are from her album ‘The Devil Is Loose’, such as ‘Space Talk’, but were too disco-tinged for this record, so this Marvin Gaye cover won the day.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JLhr-C_KGQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It was amazing to have the legend that is Asha herself turn up to the Dishoom Carnaby launch party, and too tempting not to play a couple of her tracks whilst I was DJing that night. I wondered if she had spotted them (which she had) when I was privileged enough to hang out with her and Gilles Peterson a few days later at a recording of his Radio 6 Music show with included an interview with Asha. It was clear she was loving her experience with Dishoom and was even talking about live shows and a new record.</p>
<p>If and when it becomes time to piece together a second Dishoom compilation album, I wouldn’t be surprised if Asha finds her way on to it. What’s for sure though is it will be fun putting it together. All the best things are a labour of love after all, much like Dishoom itself.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A celebration of brotherhood]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the window of Dishoom King’s Cross, we painted the iconic and resounding words of the great Rabindranath Tagore:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;<br />
Where knowledge is free;<br />
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow<br />
domestic walls;<br />
Where words come out from the depth of the truth;<br />
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;<br />
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary<br />
desert sand of dead habit;<br />
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action<br />
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.</em></p>
<p>Tagore was a true visionary. He saw it as deeply important that people live freely and harmoniously and that they set aside those prejudices that have the power to divide people and even nations. And on 16<sup>th </sup>October 1905 Tagore peacefully put these beliefs into action.</p>
<p>On this date, the British Empire broke up Tagore&#8217;s beloved Bengal on the basis of religion. In one move, the make-up of a nation would be changed, its people pulled up by the roots and displaced to foreign soil. But rather than accept his country being torn in two, Tagore felt compelled to make a stand for unity. He sought to inspire love, respect and a vow of mutual protection between Hindus and Muslims and so invoked the spirit of <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/raksha-bandhan-the-sacred-bond/">Raksha Bandhan</a>, which in Sanskrit means &#8220;the knot of protection&#8221;. Though it is traditionally celebrated between brothers and sisters, Tagore saw an opportunity to extend the meaning of the festival to bring together the people of Bengal. And so he called for the whole community to show their solidarity. Hindus and Muslims took to the streets in peaceful protest, and tied <em>rakhis</em> (the cotton threads that symbolise love and protection) on one another. The statement was clear: <strong>Do not divide us. We are all brothers and sisters here. </strong></p>
<p>Through this humble gesture they showed that they were united as a community, and on that day in 1905, the tying of the rahki became a symbol of brotherhood, of humanity, of peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>These days those events are largely forgotten, eclipsed by the turmoil of later years. We Hindus enjoy Raksha Bandhan as a celebration of the <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/raksha-bandhan-the-sacred-bond/">precious bond between brother and sister</a>. We&#8217;re very fond indeed of this little festival and the way it brings our families together every year to remind us of the ties that bind us.</p>
<p>And yet our minds often snag on Tagore&#8217;s poem. We share his vision – our world should not be broken into fragments by narrow domestic walls of race, caste, religion or any other marks of difference. And a celebration such as <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-the-festival-of-light/">Diwali</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/eid/">Eid</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/">Holi</a> or Raksha Bandhan is a great source of joy and, as such, should be shared freely. And so, this Raksha Bandhan, we invite everyone &#8211; all humans, not just our Hindu brother-and-sister pairs &#8211; to celebrate this lovely, gentle festival with us.</p>
<p>This year, Raksha Bandhan will fall on Saturday 29<sup>th</sup> August (depending on the moon!). On this day, we will be gifting you all a rakhi or two, to tie on whomever you choose as a symbol of your love and friendship. It could be a sibling, a friend, a neighbour, or even a stranger – it should be anyone you want to share a little happiness and goodwill with! (There&#8217;ll also be mithai for everyone, and the requisite materials for anyone wishing to do a little pooja with us &#8211; just ask!)</p>
<p>Wishing you all a very happy Raksha Bandhan!</p>
<p><em>Please do note that Dishoom Covent Garden is closed until Monday 31st August, so Raksha Bandhan celebrations are only taking place at Dishoom Shoreditch and Dishoom King&#8217;s Cross.</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[The ritual of Zakat]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Compassion. Generosity. Discipline. Honesty. Selflessness. Tolerance. These principles lie at the heart of Islam. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are bound to give, share and take care of others – whether those joined by family bonds or by friendship, or simply those less fortunate than themselves.</p>
<p>Faith doesn’t just mean believing in God – it means tangible actions and rituals, built around the Five Pillars of Islam. Carrying out these Pillars (<em>Iman</em>, serving god; <em>Salah</em>, prayer five times each day; <em>Sawm</em>, fasting during <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/ramadan/">Ramadan</a>; <em>Hajj</em>, making the pilgrimage to Mecca, and <em>Zakat</em>, charity) is the foundation of each day and is like a compass to guide one through life.</p>
<p>Thus, as a Muslim, charity is not just something to be carried out when the mood strikes you; it really is a lifelong duty. There are even rules on how much each person should donate from their earnings each year. Giving generously and regularly, and offering aid to those less fortunate – both within and outside the community – is part of the essence of Islam.</p>
<p>During Ramadan, this essence is alive more than ever. Alongside the rituals of prayer and fasting, giving is a natural element of this auspicious month. It is a time for sacrifice and self-discipline; and parting with hard-earned money for the benefit of others is a reminder that we are not defined by our possessions, but by our purpose.</p>
<p>Whether you are fasting or whether you are of a different faith, Ramadan is an opportunity to honour the universal values of love, giving and unity. In doing so, we just might remind ourselves that we all have much more in common than we think. In these troubled times of extremist madness and lazy scapegoating, such a celebration of our universal spirit seems good and right.</p>
<p>So – wishing you all Ramadan Mubarak! May your prayers and fasts be accepted.</p>
<p><em>During Ramadan, the month of giving, we are privileged to be supporting two wonderful charities: <a href="http://www.magicbreakfast.com/">Magic Breakfast</a>, in London, and <a href="http://www.akshayapatra.org/">Akshaya Patra</a>, in India. Both charities provide nourishing, free school meals for children who don’t get enough food at home. So, for every guest who eats with us this month, we’ll feed another two in need, meaning every meal we serve equals three full bellies.</em></p>
<p><em>Every evening at the time of breaking fast – which falls around 9.20pm – we’ll be serving the traditional dates and refreshing Nimbu Pani to anyone waiting outside for a table, to keep you going until dinner!</em></p>
<p><em>We’ll also be holding a special event to celebrate <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/eid-al-fitr/">Eid al-Fitr</a> – which marks the end of Ramadan – on Sunday 19th July – details coming soon…</em></p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE – AUGUST 2015</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We welcomed 81,034 of you during Ramadan, so we&#8217;ve made donations that mean that each charity can now serve the same number of breakfasts or lunches to children who would otherwise go hungry – a total of 162,068 meals.</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back here again. A burra peg of Horniman’s Old Fashioned at my elbow. Tiredness beginning to envelop me in its seductive fug. I’m tempted to give in. I’m sitting here in the Long Bar at our (newest) <a title="The King’s Cross Godown" href="http://www.dishoom.com/in-which-a-young-irani-opens-a-cafe-in-a-godown-behind-victoria-terminus-c-1928/" target="_blank">café in King’s Cross </a>looking up at an oversized clock. We have these big clocks everywhere. I wonder why. Is it some kind of a metaphor? The clock in Shoreditch is actually only right for 6 months of the year because we can’t adjust it for British Summer Time. Perhaps that has deeper significance. Then again, perhaps not.</p>
<p>Last year I wondered whether I was becoming a predictable and sad old git. This year I don’t have to wonder. Here I am again, looking back. I feel a mixture of relief that it’s over, much gratitude for all of the good things, all of the good people, all of the laughter and love, and inevitably there is a little sadness. It’s been a pretty hard year for many reasons. Somehow, though, I don’t begrudge getting older. Salt has almost vanquished the pepper these days, but I’m at peace with the fact that you can’t stop all the clocks.</p>
<p>And, as always at this time of year, our thoughts are drawn to the past. It is four and a half years since we were getting ready to open the first Dishoom on St. Martin’s Lane. I remember it being terrifying and exciting and we were most certainly inexperienced and naïve. And I have to say it definitely showed. But you stick at things, and you try to learn from your mistakes.</p>
<p>Back then, we (quite sensibly) thought our job was simply to serve Londoners good food and good drink. But, almost five years on, we’ve come to the realisation that there’s another reason we find ourselves getting out of bed in the mornings. For us, there is no greater pleasure than in bringing people together; to enjoy themselves, of course, but also to relax and play in the company of people from all cultures and backgrounds. In our world – the one we’d like to create for our guests, and for our team – everyone is utterly at ease and at peace with one another. Differences a cause for celebration rather than judgment.</p>
<p>I feel very strongly that Dishoom should be – has to be – a place where the hard up student (who loves bottomless chai) can sit next to the rich steel magnate (who might order bottles of Ruinart), and where the Muslim family can share a table with the Hindu teenagers. Where your interest might be drawn by news of a <a title="Our Holi party 2014" href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/" target="_blank">big Holi party</a>, or an <a title="Eid Milan photos" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.934664053226743.1073741830.109165852443238&amp;type=3" target="_blank">Eid celebration</a>, or a <a title="Diwali – the Festival of Light" href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-the-festival-of-light/" target="_blank">Diwali feast</a>. Where your eye might be caught by the Zoroastrian Asho Farohar on the wall, or the statue of Ganesh-ji by the entrance. Where our stories of Satyagraha, sacrifice and independence might be told. Where <a title="Haleem – a slow-cooked delicacy" href="http://www.dishoom.com/haleem-a-slow-cooked-delicacy/" target="_blank">Haleem</a> and Nihari can sit comfortably on the table alongside Pau Bhaji, Bhel and Bun Maska, and locally-brewed London beers.</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding presumptuous, I’d like to think that, in our own small way, we can become a means to celebrate the many, varied cultures and traditions that make Bombay (and London) so special. These two cities don’t just contain diversity; they are actually defined by it – defined by their layers of accumulated difference. To deny this (as people try to do) is surely to deny the very nature of the cities themselves.</p>
<p>Naresh Fernandes writes in his (excellent) book, ‘<a title="Bombay / A City Adrift" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/City-Adrift-Short-Biography-Bombay/dp/938227720X" target="_blank">Bombay &#8211; A City Adrift</a>’, that shared spaces are what makes a city human. The Irani cafés were exactly such shared spaces, and thus they helped to make Bombay the more tolerant and vibrant place it was, and still is. But though they played such an important role, for various reasons their numbers have dwindled from 400 to 25 or so. That a city of 20 million people cannot sustain such invaluable places is an incredible loss.</p>
<p>In fact, it often strikes me that London, Bombay and most of the other cities I know – they’re all becoming more and more separated, more exclusive. Rising inequality drives accelerating property prices. More flash cars. More expensive restaurants. More and more exclusive enclaves. As the city grows &#8211; and grows more prosperous &#8211; we have to do the real work of making sure that it’s a shared city. Making sure that we find ways to do stuff together and to break down barriers. It’s really important. A city that doesn’t do this becomes ghetto-ised and divided, full of suspicion; a sullen dystopia.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we received our first ‘hate mail.’ Somebody wanted to book a table, and then didn’t. Not because of our booking policy, but because there were pictures of smiling Muslim children on our website observing Ramadan. Because we are Hindus celebrating Eid with storytelling and feasting. The language was angry, threatening and obscene. I wish the writer of the email no ill, but as we all read the email together as a team, it bolstered our conviction. I also remember a tweet, the first time we had an Eid event at St. Martin’s Lane. A picture of three hands, three girls who had mehendi applied to their palms for Eid. One girl called Aisha, one called Geeta and one called Sarah. It was the polar opposite of that hate mail.</p>
<p>Which brings me back, I suppose, to 2014. Around the world, this year was in desperate need of more tolerance and became progressively more dark and scary. Palestine. Isis. Ebola. Boko Haram. Russia and Ukraine. The Ferguson riots. Pakistani children being slaughtered in the name of religion. It seemed that everywhere, real or imagined barriers were being thrown up, bolstered, or harshly enforced. And many of those who dared cross the lines suffered severe penalties. The worst truly seemed to be full of passionate intensity while the best lacked conviction.</p>
<p>Here in England, Mr. Farage and his pint would have been funny (breastfeeding, blaming M4 traffic on immigration – Nige, mate, really?) if he wasn’t slightly scary and the Scots were keen to put up their own barriers. So far, nothing changed, but to me, it’s the undercurrent which feels wrong. There seems to be a keenness to draw boundaries, to emphasise difference and shut off from other communities, when more and more, surely, we need the exact opposite.</p>
<p>In other news, we also said some tearful goodbyes. Maya Angelou, that demolisher of barriers, the caged bird who sang. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and his great talent. I’m exactly the right age to have loved the Dead Poets Society, to have treasured the Fisher King and to want to be the <a title="The Genie - click - you know you want to!" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60faNcX7qYo" target="_blank">Genie from Aladdin</a>. It makes me so sad that you, Mr. Williams, who gave us solace when we needed it, succumbed to your own demons. Please, rest in peace, O captain, my captain.</p>
<p>Back home in India, it was a mixed bag. We successfully made it to Mars (and with change from the budget for the movie Gravity). There are early signs that Mr. Modi might emerge a statesman but we’re not at all convinced by his nastier friends. Congress seems to be just lost. For women, the situation remains murky. Blame Uber, blame behaviour, blame revealing clothes – blame anything but those truly responsible for the horrific crimes.</p>
<p>In Bombay, B. Merwan <a title="Irani Kerfuffle" href="http://www.mid-day.com/articles/century-old-irani-cafe-b-merwan--co-downs-its-shutters/15232056" target="_blank">caused a kerfuffle</a> when the news spread that they were closing for good – only to reopen after a facelift, and now they’re busier than ever. Long live the remaining Irani cafés, I say – shared, democratic, affordable spaces, each and every one of them. As for<a title="I am not a Panda" href="http://scroll.in/article/689268/We-are-not-pandas:-Irate-Parsis-criticise-ads-urging-them-to-procreate" target="_blank"> Jiyo Parsi</a>? ‘I am not a panda’ declared our favourite Parsi friend in London.</p>
<p>Popular culture was… just barmy. Ice buckets took the world by storm. One Kim tried to <a title="Kim with few clothes" href="http://www.papermag.com/2014/11/kim_kardashian.php" target="_blank">break the internet</a>, but failed. Another Kim succeeded, completing a major hacking operation which resulted in the geopolitical earthquake of a leak of the plot of the next Bond movie and the revelation that Angelina could be a bit shirty. Solange attacked her brother-in-law Jay-Z in a lift, and then broke out in hives at her own wedding, but had the coolest <a title="Alien hipsters in white" href="http://www.vogue.com/r/h_1320,w_1320/2014/11/16/solange-knowles-alan-ferguson-wedding-dress-4.jpg" target="_blank">wedding photography</a>. And we imported the nonsensical Black Friday and started biting each other to buy TVs.</p>
<p>It seems like a truly mad old world, but, despite being baffled by the barminess, we gratefully accept our part in it. We only hope that we can continue to chip away at the barriers that divide us, and celebrate the joys that we can share.</p>
<p>We are endlessly grateful to everyone who helps us do what we do. Those who helped us <a title="Dishoom comes to life in King’s Cross" href="http://www.dishoom.com/kings-cross-comes-to-life/" target="_blank">build Dishoom in a Godown in King’s Cross</a> this year. Each and every person on the Dishoom team. Our families who are endlessly patient. All of you are wonderful, kind, and very special people, and we could not do any of it without you. And you, dear reader, dear guest, who part regularly with your hard-earned cash to allow us to feed and water you. And perhaps <a title="Our Holi party 2014" href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/" target="_blank">cover you in colourful paint</a> and regale you with <a title="Diwali and Ramayana" href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-and-ramayana/" target="_blank">stories</a>.</p>
<p>From the very bottom of all our hearts, we wish you the very best for 2015. May Ganesh-ji make all your beginnings greater, and your obstacles (and those accursed barriers) a little smaller.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A GUEST BLOG POST]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Rema emailed us out of the blue recently and we were incredibly touched by her words. She then tweaked her email into the blog post below.</em></p>
<p>As a young girl with Indian roots, growing up in nineties Britain wasn&#8217;t actually too bad.</p>
<p>I didn’t experience much racism, even when at one point I was the only brown face in a school classroom of thirty. I had friends from all backgrounds and colours. And I was happy. But every now and then, pangs of emptiness would overcome me. I would feel a bit lost. In the back of my mind, I always knew I was the outsider, looking in. That sense of belonging that I thought the other kids had, seemed to evade me.</p>
<p>I thought I might find this on my first trip to India (well, the first trip that I could actually remember). It was an awesome experience; the sights, the sounds, people were warm and welcoming. I was ‘their guest’, but still, not one of them. And there it was again. The outsider. Feeling just as lost strolling down the beaches of Kovalam, as I did driving down the winding country lanes of Kent. I started to think I’d always feel this way. Neither here. Nor there.</p>
<p>The summer of 2013, and admittedly a latecomer to the mela, saw my first visit to Dishoom. Up until this point, I’d never been to Bombay (apart from several short trips, courtesy of Air Dreams, involving Shahrukh Khan wooing me with just a flash of his dimples) and so I wasn’t sure what to expect from this ‘Bombay café’. At first, everyone looked a bit like me. A bit lost, neither here, nor there – outsiders. Suddenly, for the first time in my life, I was an outsider among many. And our differences were connecting us.</p>
<p>Being different, it seemed, was welcomed here, celebrated even. Dishoom really seemed to live up to what the Irani cafés of yore claimed to have back then &#8211; an eclectic mix of people – misfits, if you like. Their philosophy of <a href="http://www.mumbaimirror.com/others/leisure/Strictly-without-opium/articleshow/32507172.cms">creating shared spaces</a>; where rich and poor, young and old, black and white, could sit and break naan together, was definitely for all to see in this relaxed, yet vibrant café in the middle of Central London. People were enjoying what Dishoom had to offer, in his or her own special ways. I saw brown faces, white faces, heard different accents. Everyone was at ease and unassuming, conversing and laughing with each other. They were happy. And so was I. I guess <a href="https://twitter.com/drvandanashiva">Vandana Shiva</a> was right when she said, “Uniformity is not nature’s way; diversity is nature’s way.”</p>
<p>By no means did I expect Dishoom to be the place where I could finally be able to hold my head up high and say, “Yeah, at last, I belong somewhere.” And by no means did I feel this after I left the Dishoom walls. But what I did start to feel was a sense of it being OK to not fit in, to be a bit different. So, thank you Dishoom. It seems I, and a whole bunch of other misfits, owe a lot to you.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[and why we do this sort of thing ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eEVgMvN3hoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Holi’s great, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Cast your sins into the fire. Throw colours with random strangers, and random abandon. Laugh freely and joyously. Dance. Laugh again. Try to shake the colour out of your hair and try to beat the colour out of your clothes. Enjoy the sight of elderly grandparents, tiny children and everyone in between – all doing the same thing, all covered in glorious technicolour. Enjoy how surreal it is. Enjoy how magical it feels.</p>
<p>In our case, all in a big shed in Hackney. For all of you who were there, you’ll know how much fun it was. There was no actual <em>bhang</em> in our lassi, but everyone seemed as high as kites. People who had never met before were rubbing powder paint in one another&#8217;s faces, dancing and improvising a conga. And in a way, I think this is exactly what we need more of in London.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure; London is growing. Our city is getting busier and more crowded. We Londoners are forever moaning about accelerating property prices, and more flash sports cars seem to be racing pointlessly up and down Knightsbridge. And as the city grows, I’d like to think we can make sure that it’s truly a shared city. That all of us find ways to have fun together, to break down barriers, to leave aside differences and celebrate each others’ culture. Even if it’s only for a few short hours, it&#8217;s really important. A city that doesn’t do this becomes a nervous and divided city, full of suspicion; a sad dystopia. Let&#8217;s never let that happen to London.</p>
<p>So, in that spirit, we promise to keep throwing our Holi parties, if you’ll all keep coming!</p>
<p>Enjoy our little video of this year’s Holi, see the (massive) <a title="Mad Gallery" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.849356131757536.1073741829.109165852443238&amp;type=3" target="_blank">photo gallery</a> &#8211; tag yourself if you were there. And, most importantly of all, come next year!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I'm obviously turning into a predictable and sad old git.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">About this time every year I do the exact same thing. I sit in the Permit Room, a Viceroy&#8217;s Old Fashioned at my elbow, and think about the year gone by. All that&#8217;s happened and not happened. Always some ups. Always some downs. Always tears, always laughter, always joy. I suppose that&#8217;s the fun of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re asking where the time went, and wondering if we&#8217;re really any older or wiser, or just a touch barmier. There&#8217;s definitely more salt in the pepper and a little more comfort in the seat. (Roll on O January, fresh with your <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/29/juice-diet-health-juicing" target="_blank">cold press juice</a> and daily <a title="David Swenson demonstrates Ashtanga San Salutations" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQmT2yogtI4" target="_blank">Sun Salutations</a>…)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Somehow I&#8217;d like to think that each passing year brings a little more collective wisdom. Each year must make us better, surely? Perhaps sometimes it does, perhaps sometimes it doesn’t. Do we become more respectful of each others&#8217; differences? Do we become more supportive of our fellow men? Those walls that separate us &#8211; you know, <a title="Where the mind is without fear" href="http://allpoetry.com/poem/8516621-Where-The-Mind-Is-Without-Fear-by-Rabindranath-Tagore" target="_blank">the ones that Rabindranathji warned us about</a> &#8211; narrow domestic walls that break our world into petty fragments. Did we build them higher? Or did we work to dismantle them, even if we only removed a brick or two?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Late in the year came the news of <a title="Hero" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/12/new-yorker-cover-nelson-mandela.html#slide_ss_0=1" target="_blank">Madiba</a>&#8216;s death. A giant amongst men, he humbly tore down massive walls. For 27 years, he watched from prison as his people were systematically deprived of their rights, and yet he quietly stood firm in a Springboks shirt to teach us that retribution didn’t have a part in reconciliation. He created a nation anew and averted certain bloodbath. His passing certainly gave us reason to pause a moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We lost a few other good ones this year too. The blue-eyed Irish rake, <a title="&quot;We want two large glasses of lemonade&quot;" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9YXuvLfECk" target="_blank">who brought a Bedouin in from the heat for a lemonade</a>. Mr. Reed, his talent fashioned in the white light white heat of Andy’s Factory. He looked good in eye shadow and influenced just about everyone who later made records. Two Auntijis – Tarla-ji whose cookbooks must grace every Indian kitchen and Maggie-ji, who certainly chiseled modern Britain. The Little Master left too; he’s still with us in Bombay, but lost to the wonderful game of leather on willow <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNX1beRgwJ8" target="_blank">taught so successfully by the British</a> (Memsahibs) to us (tax-dodging but handsome) natives. We’ll miss his grace and his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHz20jWtvPE" target="_blank">cover drive</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other sport news, we were thoroughly carried away by the ascent of the once-awkward Mr. Murray. He transformed himself in front of our eyes from the gangly Scot from Gregory’s Girl to a muscled statesman of tennis, a legendary Brit. Less convincing, of course, were the ash-less and whitewashed English cricketers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The year, inevitably, brought much sadness too. Before we had grieved the horrific death of the young woman raped in Delhi, came the gang rape of a journalist in the Mahalaxmi Mills in Bombay. Appalling violence against women seemed to be everywhere. We were angry. Was India really this lawless? In some ways, however, it seemed we had too much law; December brought with it the decision to recriminalise homosexuality, <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vikram-seth-on-gay-rights-homosexuality/1/332025.html?source=hometoplead" target="_blank">to make good people into outlaws</a>, a firm step backwards to greater intolerance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People across India marveled at Mr. Modi, the man, the orator, the 3D avatar hologram, and many were taken by Gujarat’s growth, but we found it hard not to be shaken by <a title="Arundhati on Godhra" href="http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?215477" target="_blank">the past of a man </a>who may yet become Prime Minister of Hindus, Muslims and Christians alike and equal. Certainly he seems more at ease than Mr. Gandhi who gets older but always seems too young.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elsewhere, the world suffered. Syria appalled us. The earth quaked in China, and a typhoon raged through the Philippines. A factory in Bangladesh collapsed and exposed rot in the West. Cyprus was (just about) bailed out while Mrs. Merkel sort of held it together. Nairobi&#8217;s Westgate Centre shocked while Cairo burned. Two bombs shook Boston.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pop culture continued to fascinate us. The smiley virus twerked. Mr. Thicke thought he was ironic and blurring lines, but we knew he was just plain crass. (He does look like Simon Cowell, doesn’t he?) Harlem shook repeatedly. What was that about? Wholesome and lovely Ms. Lawson (or should we say Hi-gella?) fell from grace, while Mr. Saatchi was the worst he could be. We were secretly impressed that the Domestic Goddess was also a hardcore party girl. The deliciously bad Mr. Heisenberg finally broke. Two randomly daft Frenchmen in helmets got lucky, while the fashionable Mr. Bowie and the motherly Mrs. Carter came back unannounced. Kanye and Kim produced baby North, surname West. It was the year of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/dec/12/selfie-belfie-lelfie-peoples-legs" target="_blank">selfie</a> (and the belfie and the helfie, apparently), which we took while wearing onesies which we paid for with bitcoins. We ate ever more burgers and chicken was just clucking everywhere. Cronuts came and went.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our world, we feasted on <a title="The Ginger Pig Bacon Naan Roll" href="http://dishoom.com/the-ginger-pig-bacon-naan-roll/" target="_blank">Ginger Pig Bacon Naans</a>, basked in the unusually glorious summer sun on our new <a title="The Verandah at Dishoom Shoreditch" href="http://dishoom.com/the-verandah-at-dishoom-shoreditch/" target="_blank">Verandah</a>, and finally celebrated a proper <a title="Play Holi with Dishoom" href="http://dishoom.com/play-holi-with-dishoom/" target="_blank">Holi (which was properly technicolour awesome)</a>. We ate Haleem at <a title="Eid al-Fitr, the Celebration of Breaking Fast" href="http://dishoom.com/eid-al-fitr/" target="_blank">Eid</a> and watched the Ramayana come to life at <a title="Diwali at Dishoom" href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali/" target="_blank">Diwali</a>. We tried to <a title="Catch a memory and bake it onto a plate" href="http://dishoom.com/the-important-work-of-preserving-memory/" target="_blank">catch memories of the Irani Cafés and baked them on to plates</a>. And we had the best time ever when we got the whole Dishoom clan together (the whole caboodle &#8211; all of us, our families, our suppliers, their families) for our inaugural <a title="The whole caboodle - just fab" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOojG2OwKoU&amp;" target="_blank">Family Mela</a>. (We apologised for closing both cafés, and received an overwhelming response to our placatory offer thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=699481100078374&amp;set=pb.109165852443238.-2207520000.1388411274.&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">this sign</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Who really inspired us this year? It was those who broke down walls. Like the Muslims <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/20/bradford-synagogue-saved-muslims-jews" target="_blank">who saved the synagogue in Bradford</a>. Like brave, firm of purpose <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000002485983/the-making-of-malala.html" target="_blank">Malala</a>; if you are not moved by a teenage girl prepared to face bullets for her right to go to school, what are you moved by? Pope Francis &#8211; <a href="http://distractify.com/people/reasons-why-pope-francis-is-the-person-of-the-year/" target="_blank">truly amazing</a>. He washed the feet of women and Muslims, refused to judge homosexuals, sold his Harley to benefit the homeless and critiqued the harsh aspects of capitalism. He may not have &#8216;done&#8217; anything yet &#8211; but he has already dramatically changed the tone of the conversation. And then there are the <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-08/india/34321662_1_robert-vadra-banana-republic-iac" target="_blank">Mango People of the Banana Republic</a>, the Aam Aadmi, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21591652-stunning-debut-left-leaning-anti-graft-party-sweeping-up" target="_blank">who may yet change both the tenor and substance </a>of our almost comprehensively corrupt politics in India. Mr. Kejriwal certainly has a task on his hands in Delhi, but millions are watching and willing him to succeed.</p>
<p>In our own small way, I suppose we&#8217;re trying to chip away at the walls. We can’t right every wrong, and who knows, the Palestinians and the Israelis may never find peace. But within our world, inside the threshold of Dishoom, we’d like to think that we can create a warmer world, a more innocent, barmy kind of place. Where we can all express ourselves a little and where we can all bring out the best in each other. Where Geeta, Sarah and Ayesha can celebrate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.709822005710950.1073741827.109165852443238&amp;type=3" target="_blank">Eid</a> together. Where <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10100660424717608&amp;set=vb.109165852443238&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">Holi</a> wipes the slate clean whoever you are, whatever you believe. Where Pau Bhaji, Turkey Raan, Keema and Koliwada, all with their various religious pedigrees can jostle happily for room at the same table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, next year, we’re going to keep chipping a little. We’ll keep serving chai, making drinks, feeding you and looking after you. We’ll keep inviting you to Holi and <a title="New Year’s Eve" href="http://www.dishoom.com/bombayglam/" target="_blank">barmy New Year&#8217;s Eve parties</a>. We&#8217;ll keep trying to get non-Muslims to learn about Eid and non-Hindus to learn about Diwali. And at least in our world, we can try to make sure the world is as it should be, where difference is a cause for celebration and not judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As ever, we reach into our hearts and wish you all the very best for 2014. We thank &#8211; profusely &#8211; all of those who helped us do what we do. Without our teams, without our families, and without you, our guests, we are literally nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sincerely, once again, in 2014 may Ganesh-ji make all your beginnings greater, your obstacles (and walls) a little smaller and your laughter a little louder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy new year!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ON A SUNNY DAY, SOMEWHERE IN EAST LONDON]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a summer afternoon, unusually sunny; hot, humid and expectant, like Bombay just before the monsoon. The kind of day that might make Londoners stop in their tracks, stare for a minute at the surprising blue of the sky, and clock out of work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside Dishoom Shoreditch, on the Verandah, the serious business of lounging is in progress. People spill out from the shadows, and laze gratefully in the sunlight. Ice cubes clink inside crystal tumblers. Sunlight warms the brocade fabrics and carved wood of the heavy antique furniture. Shelves – filled with well-thumbed books – sit beside faded old photographs. A thin coil of sandalwood smoke rises from gently burning incense, and scratchy old jazz (<a title="Bombay had a jazz age! Who knew?!" href="http://www.tajmahalfoxtrot.com/?page_id=25" target="_blank">Taj Mahal Foxtrot</a>, anyone?) floats out of a 78 playing on the old gramophone. A light breeze ruffles the pages of the Times of India on the sideboard. The armchair creaks as someone settles further into its inviting bulk, sighing with contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ties are loosened, layers sloughed off. The scent of mint from a freshly-mixed Julep lingers in the air. A waitress refills glasses of Chai from a large battered teapot. Tempting snacks are ordered and passed around, shared, enjoyed; hungry fingers sneak the last pieces of Okra and Skate Cheeks from their bowls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chatter of voices and gentle laughter carries onto Boundary Street, and sparks the interest of passers-by. These are the pleasant signs of friends and colleagues at leisure, enjoying an afternoon out on the Verandah. Perhaps they’re even bunking off, absconding from their screens, getting slowly, happily blotto.</p>
<p> Sadly, it wouldn’t be very sensible to have an entirely outdoor Verandah. This is London, not Bombay. Little monsoons occur daily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we invite you to join us at our lovely, new, indoor-outdoor Verandah at Dishoom Shoreditch. Pleasantly cozy, covered and warmed when the weather is inclement, but not when it’s hot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On any day of the week, breakfast on the Verandah is relaxed, with Bacon Naans, fresh fruit, and eggs served several ways – Omelettes, Akuri or fried sunny-side-up in a naan – accompanied by strong Monsooned Malabar coffee, or endless refills of our very good House Chai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At lunch, different persons may rub shoulders – friends eating, creatives creating, ladies lunching and workers giving up their desks for an armchair (complete with ChaiFi).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Afternoons are the perfect time to take tea, perhaps accompanied by one or two small plates, or biscuits from the bakery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And as evening falls, Sundowners – that great Bombay tradition – are served. A Gin Fizz, Madame? Or maybe you’d rather a Julep? Perhaps a Viceroy’s Old Fashioned for you, Sir. It’s a Bombay Pimm’s for me, I think.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So – we very much hope you’ll come and indulge in a little relaxed Bombay lounging with us on the indoor-outdoor Verandah, for whatever the occasion might be, and with no heed whatsoever paid to the weather.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[IN A WAY, ALL THAT WE ARE IS A BUNDLE OF MEMORIES.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From the moment we arrive, we accumulate our own layers of stories and experiences, remembered events and remembered emotions. Together, they become our own personal narratives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But for something so integral, so basic to who we are, memory feels so fleetingly ethereal. The fragrance of a little sponge cake (perhaps Madeleine, perhaps Mawa), the rich salty taste of butter melting on a bun dipped in hot chai, the sounds of a particular street, the soft touch of a companion’s hand, the wistful sweetness of a moment. The utterly unique moment is here, and then it’s gone. And the only trace left behind of its existence is an imperfect imprint on our minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can we preserve this memory? How can we capture a feeling or a sensation, a poignant moment, before it fades like the morning mist?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bombay’s beautiful Irani Cafés have been fading into memory for years. They once numbered a few hundred. Now only twenty-five or so remain and more seem to close with each year. These cafés which were once part of the fabric of Bombay life are fading away steadily from the collective memory of the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All who know the Irani cafés nurture treasured stories of them. They were places for bunking off school, for bashful teenage trysts, for debating politics and cinema with the idealistic bravery of youth, for escaping – deeply – into a book, accompanied by endless chai. The Irani Cafés were lovely places for growing up – and for growing old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And they were important places too. In a city all too busy making harsh social judgments, the Irani Cafés were truly shared spaces. Anyone could find refuge here for the few paise it took to buy a cup of chai &#8211; Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Parsi. The poor student, the famous artist, the tired taxi-wallah, even the hooker, shunned elsewhere. Differences leveled, tolerance a given. A city without these shared social spaces collapses into prejudice, dystopia and even violence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But sooner or later, for all the love that people have for them, the Irani Cafés may all be gone. Faded away, unnoticed, in the rush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our own small way, we thought we could contribute to the capture of memory. We already pay homage to the Irani Cafés through design and food, but we thought we could go further and document and preserve actual recollections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We gathered stories from those who know and love the Irani Cafés – guests at Dishoom, the owners of the remaining cafés, others in Bombay and London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We then literally baked these stories onto eighty of our plates (at 850C).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now – if you come to Dishoom in Shoreditch, you’ll notice stories on the plates. You can read about marriage proposals, about cantankerous owners, about rotis so good they had to be flown across continents, about double omelets and sweet chai. If you pause briefly, you may even feel a sense of how those moments – now passed forever – actually felt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed – we also invite you to look at the plates online in a <a href="http://platewallah.dishoom.com">gallery,</a> and share your own Irani café stories, if you have them. We’ll bake the best of these stories into our café in Shoreditch too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s truly our honour and privilege to be doing the important work of preserving the memory and telling the stories of the Irani Cafés of 20<sup>th</sup> century Bombay.</p>
