				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In September 2013, at Dishoom Shoreditch, we’re hosting a ‘cabinet of curiosity’ curated by <i>This is Provenance</i> as part of the London Design Festival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our cabinet was once used for family heirlooms in India. Today, we’ll be exhibiting a series of illustrated plates which attempt to capture the memories of those who know and love the original Irani cafés of Bombay. These plates were created in collaboration with OgilvyOne and by gathering the stories of hundreds of people who have spent time in the Irani Cafés.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The stories are truly touching: one contributor remembers a poorer customer pouring their chai into a saucer to share it with a friend, another recalls the delight of her first taste of tutti-frutti ice-cream. Still more remember turning points in their lives – a revelation about one’s path in life, a coming of age – taking place in the shade of the cafés. Together, the plates represent the collective memories of those who ate, drank and lingered in these disappearing spaces. You can see the full range of plates <a href="http://platewallah.dishoom.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cabinet will also display work from two designers inspired by the subcontinent. London-based Jasleen Kaur will display her ingenious Tala Curry Measure, a tribute to how recipes are passed down through the generations in Indian families. Australian designer Sian Pascale, who lives and works in Bombay, will be exploring individuality and disposability with her contemporary interpretations of traditional earthenware chai cups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re proud to be part of Encounters with Provenance and the London Design Festival this year, and we’re inspired by the great designers working in Shoreditch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop by this week for a chai – we’d like to show you the treasures in our cabinet.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ON A SUNNY DAY, SOMEWHERE IN EAST LONDON]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a summer afternoon, unusually sunny; hot, humid and expectant, like Bombay just before the monsoon. The kind of day that might make Londoners stop in their tracks, stare for a minute at the surprising blue of the sky, and clock out of work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside Dishoom Shoreditch, on the Verandah, the serious business of lounging is in progress. People spill out from the shadows, and laze gratefully in the sunlight. Ice cubes clink inside crystal tumblers. Sunlight warms the brocade fabrics and carved wood of the heavy antique furniture. Shelves – filled with well-thumbed books – sit beside faded old photographs. A thin coil of sandalwood smoke rises from gently burning incense, and scratchy old jazz (<a title="Bombay had a jazz age! Who knew?!" href="http://www.tajmahalfoxtrot.com/?page_id=25" target="_blank">Taj Mahal Foxtrot</a>, anyone?) floats out of a 78 playing on the old gramophone. A light breeze ruffles the pages of the Times of India on the sideboard. The armchair creaks as someone settles further into its inviting bulk, sighing with contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ties are loosened, layers sloughed off. The scent of mint from a freshly-mixed Julep lingers in the air. A waitress refills glasses of Chai from a large battered teapot. Tempting snacks are ordered and passed around, shared, enjoyed; hungry fingers sneak the last pieces of Okra and Skate Cheeks from their bowls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chatter of voices and gentle laughter carries onto Boundary Street, and sparks the interest of passers-by. These are the pleasant signs of friends and colleagues at leisure, enjoying an afternoon out on the Verandah. Perhaps they’re even bunking off, absconding from their screens, getting slowly, happily blotto.</p>
<p> Sadly, it wouldn’t be very sensible to have an entirely outdoor Verandah. This is London, not Bombay. Little monsoons occur daily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we invite you to join us at our lovely, new, indoor-outdoor Verandah at Dishoom Shoreditch. Pleasantly cozy, covered and warmed when the weather is inclement, but not when it’s hot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On any day of the week, breakfast on the Verandah is relaxed, with Bacon Naans, fresh fruit, and eggs served several ways – Omelettes, Akuri or fried sunny-side-up in a naan – accompanied by strong Monsooned Malabar coffee, or endless refills of our very good House Chai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At lunch, different persons may rub shoulders – friends eating, creatives creating, ladies lunching and workers giving up their desks for an armchair (complete with ChaiFi).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Afternoons are the perfect time to take tea, perhaps accompanied by one or two small plates, or biscuits from the bakery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And as evening falls, Sundowners – that great Bombay tradition – are served. A Gin Fizz, Madame? Or maybe you’d rather a Julep? Perhaps a Viceroy’s Old Fashioned for you, Sir. It’s a Bombay Pimm’s for me, I think.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So – we very much hope you’ll come and indulge in a little relaxed Bombay lounging with us on the indoor-outdoor Verandah, for whatever the occasion might be, and with no heed whatsoever paid to the weather.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[IN A WAY, ALL THAT WE ARE IS A BUNDLE OF MEMORIES.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From the moment we arrive, we accumulate our own layers of stories and experiences, remembered events and remembered emotions. Together, they become our own personal narratives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But for something so integral, so basic to who we are, memory feels so fleetingly ethereal. The fragrance of a little sponge cake (perhaps Madeleine, perhaps Mawa), the rich salty taste of butter melting on a bun dipped in hot chai, the sounds of a particular street, the soft touch of a companion’s hand, the wistful sweetness of a moment. The utterly unique moment is here, and then it’s gone. And the only trace left behind of its existence is an imperfect imprint on our minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can we preserve this memory? How can we capture a feeling or a sensation, a poignant moment, before it fades like the morning mist?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bombay’s beautiful Irani Cafés have been fading into memory for years. They once numbered a few hundred. Now only twenty-five or so remain and more seem to close with each year. These cafés which were once part of the fabric of Bombay life are fading away steadily from the collective memory of the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All who know the Irani cafés nurture treasured stories of them. They were places for bunking off school, for bashful teenage trysts, for debating politics and cinema with the idealistic bravery of youth, for escaping – deeply – into a book, accompanied by endless chai. The Irani Cafés were lovely places for growing up – and for growing old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And they were important places too. In a city all too busy making harsh social judgments, the Irani Cafés were truly shared spaces. Anyone could find refuge here for the few paise it took to buy a cup of chai &#8211; Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Parsi. The poor student, the famous artist, the tired taxi-wallah, even the hooker, shunned elsewhere. Differences leveled, tolerance a given. A city without these shared social spaces collapses into prejudice, dystopia and even violence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But sooner or later, for all the love that people have for them, the Irani Cafés may all be gone. Faded away, unnoticed, in the rush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our own small way, we thought we could contribute to the capture of memory. We already pay homage to the Irani Cafés through design and food, but we thought we could go further and document and preserve actual recollections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We gathered stories from those who know and love the Irani Cafés – guests at Dishoom, the owners of the remaining cafés, others in Bombay and London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We then literally baked these stories onto eighty of our plates (at 850C).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now – if you come to Dishoom in Shoreditch, you’ll notice stories on the plates. You can read about marriage proposals, about cantankerous owners, about rotis so good they had to be flown across continents, about double omelets and sweet chai. If you pause briefly, you may even feel a sense of how those moments – now passed forever – actually felt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed – we also invite you to look at the plates online in a <a href="http://platewallah.dishoom.com">gallery,</a> and share your own Irani café stories, if you have them. We’ll bake the best of these stories into our café in Shoreditch too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s truly our honour and privilege to be doing the important work of preserving the memory and telling the stories of the Irani Cafés of 20<sup>th</sup> century Bombay.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[One day, an eccentric old Irani…]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">One day, an eccentric old Irani Café (born circa 1930, Bombay), creaking slightly at the seams, made the long trip from Bombay in 1970 to London in 2012. Tired from the long journey, it shuffled into an empty space in Shoreditch and made itself comfortable. This old Café had for some time been maintaining correspondence with its slightly more showy cousin who had made a similar trip and had found a home in Covent Garden.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, while the cousin in Covent Garden had worked hard to polish, primp and style itself, this Café was less concerned. <span id="GRmark_f38a714ae4d2fdcfcd281c87f7b9b4cf32ce2849_It:0" class="GRcorrect">It</span> knew instinctively that the layers of imperfection and eccentricity built up over the many years of serving customers in Bombay weren’t merely clutter to be cleaned up and scratches to be polished out, but were in fact its very memory and character. <span id="GRmark_b2735617185f9895e9723617503a28abfb386879_It:0" class="GRcorrect">It</span> decided to leave its disheveled corners right where they were, as little reminders of home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gradually, as it grew to know and love its new community, it <span id="GRmark_5fea990ab5caf830269b062652a60163a6910c18_realised:0" class="GRcorrect">realised</span> that it felt very much at home in it. The customers enjoyed hearing its stories of old Bombay, many of which were even true. They liked the faded pictures of the relatives on the walls. They smiled as they gradually grew to know the quirks of this old Café – which seemed constantly to be hankering after a lost mid-century Bombay. They seemed to care little that the shininess of the Covent Garden cousin was absent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And most of all the Café loved serving food and drink with so much enthusiasm. The food which came quickly out of the open kitchen. The Lamb <span id="GRmark_00a61516b8e91a8901b90528354328fce2f61b0e_Raan:0" class="GRcorrect">Raan</span> which had been <span id="GRmark_00a61516b8e91a8901b90528354328fce2f61b0e_cooked:1" class="GRcorrect">cooked</span> overnight and seemed completely at home in a burger. The warm baked biscuits and Keema puffs, just like those still being served at Sassannian Café in Bombay. The endless cups of <span id="GRmark_a8d55f4b2eaccee3e1e9c7ee13d4c2333f3a299f_chai:0" class="GRcorrect">chai</span>, the best thing to revive energy levels on a wilted Tuesday afternoon. The bar, which served the most delicious and sincere old cocktails – Flips, Gimlets, Juleps and Sours, felt even a bit pre-‘47.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brunch on Sunday would be deliciously lazy, laced warmly with the aroma of the bakery. Lunch with colleagues on a Wednesday, busy and brisk, waiters bustling <span id="GRmark_f8961a3f4a9e58dd55280c1557e24ff94c90fde0_on to:0" class="GRcorrect">on to</span> the verandah with trays of abundant food. Afternoon <span id="GRmark_353e3efa79b5f48e5d611048700f3616724b0625_chai:0" class="GRcorrect">chai</span> would provide a calm refuge from the East London street. Meanwhile, dinner and drinks on a Friday or Saturday night would see the place at its liveliest, buzzing with Londoners coming to a good old knees-up hosted by the eccentric old Café.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout, the Café smiled inwardly to itself. It was never happier than when it was being true to itself and serving its guests &#8211; sharing its love for Bombay, serving its food, telling its stories. And before too long, the Café began to feel as if it had always been there wedged comfortably into Boundary Street, accumulating its own East London layers.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[On the Southbank (May 13th - Oct 4th 2011)]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sadly, the Chowpatty Beach Bar has now left the Southbank </strong>– <a title="Goodbye Dishoom Chowpatty Beach" href="http://dishoom.com/goodbye-dishoom-chowpatty-beach/"><strong>Read its obituary here</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> Dishoom brings Bombay&#8217;s famous Chowpatty Beach to the South Bank of London for a summer party&#8230;</em></p>

</a></strong><a href="http://maps.google.co.in/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Queen+Elizabeth+Hall,+London,+United+Kingdom&amp;aq=2&amp;sll=51.505808,-0.115228&amp;sspn=0.003059,0.007607&amp;gl=in&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Queen+Elizabeth+Hall,&amp;hnear=Westminster,+London,+United+Kingdom&amp;ll=51.505948,-0.116767&amp;spn=0.003059,0.007607&amp;z=18" target="_blank">MAP</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Waterloo sunset. Pink sky, warm summer evening. Big Ben and the London Eye to the west, St Paul’s to the east. Strolling along to Southbank Centre, you see sand, bunting and hundreds of Londoners young and old, enjoying the Festival of Britain 60th anniversary celebrations.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>But then you hear the enchanting sound of Hindi music.You notice the spicy aroma of fresh Pau Bhaji. Chilled Thums Up bottles clink. Children chase balloons across the sand.You see a colourful old fishing boat, full of green coconuts, ready to be cut open and sipped from. Naughty Gola Ices look cool and tempting. Where did the old grey portakabin go? And who put this crazy Indian beach shack up on the Southbank?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It can all get a bit serious and gloomy can&#8217;t it? The cuts, the unemployment, the earthquakes, climate change. There hardly seems to be any good news, and it&#8217;s not been an easy time for us Londoners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But every now and again we have to let our collective hair down. Take a holiday. Lighten up. Do something we wouldn&#8217;t normally do. A little bit of fun and laughter makes all the difference in the world. It nourishes the soul.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This summer, the Southbank is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the original Festival of Britain, which was itself celebrated amidst the austerity of post-war reconstruction. There will be a big beach along the promenade (really!) with lots of bunting and Tracy Emin doing her first show for years, Ray Davis of the Kinks doing the Meltdown Festival and Vintage Goodwood relocating to the South Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And we wanted to do our bit as adopted Londoners. If an old Bombay Café strolled casually down to the beach (while perhaps on a mild acid trip), the result would be the Dishoom Chowpatty Beach Bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From early May to the beginning of October we&#8217;re taking you on a little summer holiday, right here in London. You&#8217;ll be able to kick off your flip flops, tuck into tasty Bombay food and sip refreshing tipples right here on the South Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And we&#8217;ve built it jugaad-style. Jugaad is a great word. It&#8217;s hindi for &#8216;making do&#8217; or &#8216;reusing&#8217; or &#8216;creative improvisation&#8217;. We&#8217;re actually already well into construction on the Southbank (go and have a look!) and we&#8217;re making do with what we can find. (Apparently, this is also called up-cycling). We&#8217;re using old materials, furnishings and decorations &#8211; brightly coloured barrels for stools, reclaimed railway sleepers as bench seating on the alfresco terrace, a bar made from recycled plastic bottles and walls erected using old tightly-rolled newspapers. There are even old freight pallets cladding the outside of the building. Look out for labels which tell you what things used to be&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enter the beach bar via an arched walkway festooned with thousands of multi-coloured used carrier bags (with some of yours if you follow our facebook page!). Faded portraits playfully subvert our more strait-laced home on St Martin’s Lane. We&#8217;ve also jazzed up the soundtrack. Our resident DJ was asked to create music which took Dishoom on a acid trip on Chowpatty Beach in 1965. (We actually haven&#8217;t heard the result yet&#8230;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The original Chowpatty beach in Bombay.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chowpatty beach is where all Bombay comes to snack and stroll. Every Bombayite has nostalgic memories of magical evenings with family and friends, enjoying the view of the Arabian Sea at dusk and the lights of the skyline across the bay.The ramshackle food stalls that pepper the beach are revered for serving the tastiest Pau Bhaji in India. Everyone has their favourite Gola-walla, who shaves ice from huge blocks, packs it onto a stick and douses it in delicious syrup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Gola-wallas at Dishoom Chowpatty beach will be serving authentic Gola flavours, alongside their playful (and naughty) twists.The rest of the drinks menu is also tempting &#8211; Bombay Pimm’s Summer Cup, Spiked Colaba Ice Tea, Classic Dishoom Chaijito, Beers, Wines, Prosecco and Pommery Pop Champagne served in baby bottles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also treat yourself to classic Bombay food, including Pau Bhaji, the Dishoom Frankie (freshly baked naan filled with spicy lamb mince), and what is almost an obsession in Bombay &#8211; the naughty Vada Pau, fried potatoes in a bun with homemade chilli chutneys – you could call it an Indian chip butty. And, we couldn&#8217;t do a menu without the  much-loved bacon naan roll &#8211; this time served all day. (Yes! All day!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, loosen that tie, roll up your trousers, bare those legs (they need the sun!) and join the party at Dishoom Chowpatty Beach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS. Make sure you &#8216;like&#8217; our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/dishoomlondon" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> for cool freebies, offers and news on events.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The narrative of the disappearing Irani Cafés has a certain wistful poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zoroastrian Iranian immigrants cross the Indian ocean from Iran to arrive in early 20th century colonial Bombay. They work in the homes of established Parsi families, leaving to set up their own cafés. These Irani cafés become an irreplaceable Bombay institution. An institution which earns a fond place in the hearts of Bombayites, regardless of caste and class, by reliably providing a cheap snack, a meal, or just a cup of <span id="GRmark_04bebec3dd9880ea193ed15e516a7a6cf75aa431_chai:0" class="GRcorrect">chai</span> and a refuge from the street.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the decades wear on eventfully, the Irani cafés peak in number in the 1960s and then start closing down. From none to four hundred and back down to twenty-five within the century. Children of café owners become lawyers and accountants. Café Coffee Day (clad in cheerful Western plastic) becomes the choice for bashful teenage trysts. Bombay becomes Mumbai and cafés become bittersweet memories. Tears are shed, but tomorrow’s modernity creeps in quickly with its own petty pace. Brave new India looks to the shiny future, and it doesn’t pause much to remember its own stories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can you tell these stories? A book would do the job, perhaps a film or a documentary. If you had a naive mind you might try and convey some of these stories in a space, in a café, through design. You would have to convey them gently, even wittily &#8211; a reference here, a joke there &#8211; and you couldn&#8217;t be too earnest or people would not listen. Of course, you would need to encourage a use of the space which supported the stories you were telling &#8211; form, function and narrative requiring unity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating a pastiche of an Irani café &#8211; perhaps an attempt at literal authenticity &#8211; would probably be a misguided errand. We&#8217;re not in Bombay, we&#8217;re not Irani immigrants and this isn&#8217;t the 1930s. However, we can still pay loving homage to this rich period narrative in a modern space in London. The marble tables, bentwood chairs, ceiling fans, ageing mirrors and monochromatic palette <span id="GRmark_ef0bb995f4694e978c36fe42c65d9a1b6696127e_are:0" class="GRcorrect">are</span> the backdrop which <span id="GRmark_ef0bb995f4694e978c36fe42c65d9a1b6696127e_start:1" class="GRcorrect">start</span> to tell the story. (There is in fact a lovely circularity here, since the Irani cafés, opened in a colonial context, were themselves homage to European cafés.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The playfully drooping wires of the pendant lights further evoke a mid 20th century Bombay (wiring always an afterthought). A Bombayite might <span id="GRmark_b42d0d583cbcbcc9e75f37a12d1b59a59317cd95_recognise:0" class="GRcorrect">recognise</span> the large art <span id="GRmark_b42d0d583cbcbcc9e75f37a12d1b59a59317cd95_deco:1" class="GRcorrect">deco</span> clock as a close replica of the one in Victoria Terminus (Bombay&#8217;s St. Pancras). The sign of rules by the door is a reference to the rules at Café Bastani which closed in the 1990s. The vintage Indian toiletries in the <span id="GRmark_700e1985bf363b38e625837cd4d0f2ec2b2f6fe7_loo:0" class="GRcorrect">loo</span> medicine cabinets have an innocent charm. The art <span id="GRmark_ecc619f64585cb4c0d40a254ca9213a8017982a8_deco:0" class="GRcorrect">deco</span> detail on the screens downstairs evokes the balconies on the city&#8217;s apartment blocks while the <span id="GRmark_ecc619f64585cb4c0d40a254ca9213a8017982a8_Gola:1" class="GRcorrect">Gola</span> machine on the bar brings back childhood memories of crushed ice treats on Chowpatty Beach. Even the shade of blue on the brickwork is close to that of <a title="Britannia Café – a vintage classic" href="http://dishoom.com/britannia-cafe-a-vintage-classic/">Britannia Café</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The artwork tells stories of its own. The owners of Irani cafés would put pictures of their ancestors on the walls. We&#8217;ve respected this tradition. My grandmother gazes confidently out of a picture taken for sending to my grandfather before their engagement was agreed. A slim sixteen year old girl in a Bombay studio in 1944, she has poise, but somehow she really doesn&#8217;t know what to expect. The photo of my <span id="GRmark_e865c430b02e05981ad704502b67294bd9366597_partners':0" class="GRcorrect">partners&#8217;</span> mother, evokes the look of the Bombay starlets of the 1960s with uncanny precision. She has the end of an arm of her spectacles in her mouth, her hair piled stylishly up on her head.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other artwork is from the posters and advertising of mid 20th century Bombay. The graphic style is beautifully simple, even naive, and catches us all in its nostalgia. We can believe that Bombay&#8217;s version of Don Draper may have dreamt up some of these campaigns. In the ladies&#8217; loo we have life size pictures of the champion Parsi body builders <span id="GRmark_bb846d29a687f60d426309296c8a343c7cae3cdc_from:0" class="GRcorrect">from</span> 1960. (I&#8217;m fairly sure that no actual Irani Café had pictures like these in their <span id="GRmark_2fb4c3c849f85cf59e2484dd08f37bcd95dfcffc_loos:0" class="GRcorrect">loos</span>, whether or not the owners were bodybuilders.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Details are important, but coherence is critical; it all must work together. The <span id="GRmark_50f020bdbc51dfb49f47530ff51ddb0088b76b4a_chai:0" class="GRcorrect">chai</span> glasses &#8211; which serve proper Bombay <span id="GRmark_50f020bdbc51dfb49f47530ff51ddb0088b76b4a_chai:1" class="GRcorrect">chai</span> &#8211; must be real <span id="GRmark_50f020bdbc51dfb49f47530ff51ddb0088b76b4a_chai:2" class="GRcorrect">chai</span> glasses from Bombay – ageless and enduring. The crockery is deliberately simple and democratic, with plates already piled on tables for sharing. The menu which refers to specific dishes from the Irani Cafés and from Bombay is suited for café style eating &#8211; easy, flexible, welcoming. Even the music is chosen carefully to evoke the Bombay and Cafés of this period. Mohammed Rafi plays one track, followed by Django Reinhardt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dieter Rams famously laid out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams" target="_blank">ten principles of good design</a>. One thing he didn’t mention is that good design can often tell a story. The story of the Irani Cafés and of 20th century Bombay is a beautiful one. One that has a certain wistful poetry. If we can, through designing Dishoom, convey even a little of this poetry, we have achieved something.</p>
