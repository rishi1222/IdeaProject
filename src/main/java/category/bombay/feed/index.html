		<description><![CDATA[Back here in the Permit Room again. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again, dear reader, I’m back here. I am the weary, be-stubbled regular propping up one end of the bar in the Permit Room at the same time every year. I have a burra peg of something stiff at my elbow. If they&#8217;d let you smoke in here, I&#8217;d be making my way slowly through the pack. It&#8217;s been a long year. I feel depleted and consumed. Nothing left in the tank.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve begun to make friends with 2015. Fifteen, you old bastard. You truly were the best of times and the worst of times. For myriad reasons, you brought with you twelve of the toughest, fullest months. Weeks that were hard, and days that could only be dealt with one at a time. And yet, sitting here on the threshold of one year and the next, sorting through the events in my head, I&#8217;m beginning to discern the lessons you were teaching.</p>
<p>We lost a family member this year. A life made unfairly, senselessly short, the grief hard. But we also experienced the smiling kindness and cheerfully unshakeable courage of someone dealing with unspeakable pain. The strength and resilience of children, the unyielding love of family. The echoes that she leaves behind sound like gentle laughter, they sound like a love of life. The twinkle in her eye somehow outlasts the tears in ours. It is humbling; cached within the intense sadness of passing, there are precious – and joyful – lessons on how to live.</p>
<p>Of course,’15 carried with it other less intense moods too, for which I’m grateful. In Dishoom’s world, you, dear patron, continued to allow us to look after you, leaving with your wallet slightly lighter and your stomach slightly heavier than when you arrived; and perhaps with your spirit a touch refreshed. You let us serve you in this way and we give you sincere, humble and heartfelt thanks; for this is our livelihood.</p>
<p>In ’15, we launched a fourth Dishoom, on Kingly Street. This time our imagination wandered into the 1960s; we became the <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/introducing-dishoom-carnaby/" target="_blank">handsome young Irani in London</a>, returning to Bombay on hearing news of his father’s passing. The result was Dishoom Carnaby in which we explored Bombay of the period, so rich in its architectural and cultural detail. We sought out and made friends with the (actual, and lovely) people our handsome Irani would have known had he been a real person. Stalwarts such as Farrukh, Dolly, Padmini, Reynold, Nissim and, of course, the indomitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha_Puthli" target="_blank">Asha</a> became a part of our life. (Asha, by the way, is a living legend who can refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" target="_blank">Andy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger" target="_blank">Mick</a> by their first names.)</p>
<p>We also discovered that when the music of the Beatles and the Stones snuck past the walls of conservative Bombay in the sixties, kids picked up their guitars and started calling themselves ‘Beat’ bands. At the same time British groups were exploring mystic exotic India and her musical (and chemical!) delights. We became interested (obsessed) with this scene and, consulting with our new friend Sidharth Bhatia and our old friend Rob Wood, we actually managed to release an album, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/music/slip-disc/" target="_blank">Slip-Disc: Dishoom’s Bombay London Grooves</a>. Our hearts were lifted when Mojo gave our album 4 stars, Uncut rated it 8/10 and the good people over at BBC radio kept talking about it and playing it. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts for lending your ears to listen to the result of our (mis)adventures!</p>
<p>Beyond the boundaries of Dishoom, though, the world had a slightly disturbing quality. We’ve previously written in these pages of our strong belief in the need to create shared spaces, to break down barriers, to celebrate difference rather than judge it. More than ever, though, it seems that the worst are full of passionate intensity and that the best lack conviction. The moronic and lethal prejudices of extremists (whether Daesh or Donald) provide the warlike drumbeat to which events seem bound to dance. Reasonable and kind voices are at risk of being drowned out by the intolerant din.</p>
<p>One thing that Daesh, Donald and their kind have in common is that they see the world as binary. Us and them. Black and white. They thrive on polarity and conflict. Daesh talks often about the ‘<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/20/isis-binary-struggle-grey-zone-jihadism" target="_blank">grey zone</a>’. This grey zone is a place in which Muslims and non-Muslims co-exist peacefully. For Daesh it’s anathema.</p>
<p>I, for one, whole-heartedly want to live in the grey zone, where we all rub up against each other. It’s a messy shared space, to be sure, but it’s colourful and joyous. The way to fight extremism, or to react to the tragic nihilistic attacks in Paris (and elsewhere, for that matter) is not to shrink or dilute the grey zone, as Donald, Marine and others would have us do, but to celebrate it, defend it, and indeed to deepen it and expand it.</p>
<p>As you may have figured out, we work pretty hard to make Dishoom a first-class grey zone. Irani Cafés were quite possibly the original Bombay grey zones. We’re not able to fix things outside our walls but we can make sure that within our walls, the world is as it should be. In Dishoom, we really like serving food cooked in Parsi, Muslim, Hindu and Christian traditions, and we do it deliberately and self-consciously. We like celebrating <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/" target="_blank">Holi</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/eid-al-fitr/" target="_blank">Eid</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-and-ramayana/" target="_blank">Diwali</a> and Christmas. We have a strong view that mixing it up is a Good Thing. There is truly no greater pleasure than in bringing people together to celebrate each other’s cultures. I can’t think of a single reason not to do this. In fact, I’d go further; in today’s political climate, we must all do this. I think we’d be barmy not to.</p>
<p>One of the best things we’ve ever done at Dishoom had its origins in June this year. A group of us were sitting around a table replete with food (which is, as you can imagine, not an uncommon event at Dishoom). We were discussing Ramadan. Our group was composed of Hindus, a less-than-conscientious Christian, a Muslim and an aspiring Buddhist. Most of us had known that charity was one of the foundations of Islam, but we learnt that the holy time of Ramadan is particularly associated with giving to those less fortunate than yourself. Our food-laden table was beautiful, but in that context it gave us pause for thought. We decided that our ‘zakat’ (or charity) for the month of Ramadan would be to feed two children in need for every meal we served. We put this into place and worked with the delightful people at Magic Breakfast and Akshaya Patra – and in the end we were able to donate funds for <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/ramadan-the-month-of-giving/" target="_blank">160,000 meals</a> to be fed to children who would otherwise go hungry.</p>
<p>A short time later, we were discussing Diwali and the Hindu new year, which is a very special time for us Hindus. Again, we discussed that we should surely be contributing to the wider world (our ever-replete table being a reliable reminder of our good fortune). Someone came up with the idea that we should, from Diwali, make our Ramadan ‘zakat’ a permanent feature of what we do at Dishoom. It just made sense. It’s surely a tragedy that in our world children still go hungry. So, from this Diwali, we pledged to feed a hungry child for each guest we serve at Dishoom.</p>
<p>I’m prouder of this than almost anything else that I’ve been involved in. So far this year, we’ve donated over a quarter of a million meals for children in India and in East London. As I think back to how we as a group were moved to do this, it feels right; Hindus, Christians, Muslims and others feeding needy children in the name of Islam for Ramadan and then making this a permanent part of Dishoom from the Hindu new year.</p>
<p>So ’15 you old bastard, my burra peg is almost drained dry. Writing your elegy is helping me to come to terms with your despair and your hope, your weeping and your laughter. I’ve blinked back a few tears, but I’m smiling.</p>
<p>I know beyond all doubt that our ’15 here at Dishoom was full to the brim with good people, without whom we’d be nothing at all. I’m proud to be part of this; to each and every person in the Dishoom team, I want to give the warmest, sincerest thank you that I am able to summon. To every one of our kind and gracious suppliers, I give deep thanks; it’s good to be working with you. We’re also utterly grateful for the bottomless and loving patience of our families. And in the end, it is you, kind and good patrons of our livelihood, who breathe life into our work and allow us to do what we do. Thank you and thank you again for coming to Dishoom, allowing us to serve you, and coming back for more.</p>
<p>Well, it’s time for me to go home to celebrate Christmas, like a good Hindu. This year, my four year old daughter is very interested in baby Jesus and has been asking me whether he’s like baby Krishna. I’m sure I’ll figure it out by the time I get home.</p>
<p>From all of us here at Dishoom, we wish you the best for Christmas and the New Year. And from the bottom of all our hearts, we wish you the very best for ’16. It probably won’t be an easy year, but we hope it’s a good year.</p>
<p>May Ganesh-ji give you the strength to deal with the tears and the openness to make the most of the joy.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A celebration of brotherhood]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the window of Dishoom King’s Cross, we painted the iconic and resounding words of the great Rabindranath Tagore:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;<br />
Where knowledge is free;<br />
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow<br />
domestic walls;<br />
Where words come out from the depth of the truth;<br />
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;<br />
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary<br />
desert sand of dead habit;<br />
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action<br />
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.</em></p>
<p>Tagore was a true visionary. He saw it as deeply important that people live freely and harmoniously and that they set aside those prejudices that have the power to divide people and even nations. And on 16<sup>th </sup>October 1905 Tagore peacefully put these beliefs into action.</p>
<p>On this date, the British Empire broke up Tagore&#8217;s beloved Bengal on the basis of religion. In one move, the make-up of a nation would be changed, its people pulled up by the roots and displaced to foreign soil. But rather than accept his country being torn in two, Tagore felt compelled to make a stand for unity. He sought to inspire love, respect and a vow of mutual protection between Hindus and Muslims and so invoked the spirit of <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/raksha-bandhan-the-sacred-bond/">Raksha Bandhan</a>, which in Sanskrit means &#8220;the knot of protection&#8221;. Though it is traditionally celebrated between brothers and sisters, Tagore saw an opportunity to extend the meaning of the festival to bring together the people of Bengal. And so he called for the whole community to show their solidarity. Hindus and Muslims took to the streets in peaceful protest, and tied <em>rakhis</em> (the cotton threads that symbolise love and protection) on one another. The statement was clear: <strong>Do not divide us. We are all brothers and sisters here. </strong></p>
<p>Through this humble gesture they showed that they were united as a community, and on that day in 1905, the tying of the rahki became a symbol of brotherhood, of humanity, of peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>These days those events are largely forgotten, eclipsed by the turmoil of later years. We Hindus enjoy Raksha Bandhan as a celebration of the <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/raksha-bandhan-the-sacred-bond/">precious bond between brother and sister</a>. We&#8217;re very fond indeed of this little festival and the way it brings our families together every year to remind us of the ties that bind us.</p>
<p>And yet our minds often snag on Tagore&#8217;s poem. We share his vision – our world should not be broken into fragments by narrow domestic walls of race, caste, religion or any other marks of difference. And a celebration such as <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-the-festival-of-light/">Diwali</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/eid/">Eid</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/">Holi</a> or Raksha Bandhan is a great source of joy and, as such, should be shared freely. And so, this Raksha Bandhan, we invite everyone &#8211; all humans, not just our Hindu brother-and-sister pairs &#8211; to celebrate this lovely, gentle festival with us.</p>
<p>This year, Raksha Bandhan will fall on Saturday 29<sup>th</sup> August (depending on the moon!). On this day, we will be gifting you all a rakhi or two, to tie on whomever you choose as a symbol of your love and friendship. It could be a sibling, a friend, a neighbour, or even a stranger – it should be anyone you want to share a little happiness and goodwill with! (There&#8217;ll also be mithai for everyone, and the requisite materials for anyone wishing to do a little pooja with us &#8211; just ask!)</p>
<p>Wishing you all a very happy Raksha Bandhan!</p>
<p><em>Please do note that Dishoom Covent Garden is closed until Monday 31st August, so Raksha Bandhan celebrations are only taking place at Dishoom Shoreditch and Dishoom King&#8217;s Cross.</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[IN A WAY, ALL THAT WE ARE IS A BUNDLE OF MEMORIES.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From the moment we arrive, we accumulate our own layers of stories and experiences, remembered events and remembered emotions. Together, they become our own personal narratives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But for something so integral, so basic to who we are, memory feels so fleetingly ethereal. The fragrance of a little sponge cake (perhaps Madeleine, perhaps Mawa), the rich salty taste of butter melting on a bun dipped in hot chai, the sounds of a particular street, the soft touch of a companion’s hand, the wistful sweetness of a moment. The utterly unique moment is here, and then it’s gone. And the only trace left behind of its existence is an imperfect imprint on our minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can we preserve this memory? How can we capture a feeling or a sensation, a poignant moment, before it fades like the morning mist?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bombay’s beautiful Irani Cafés have been fading into memory for years. They once numbered a few hundred. Now only twenty-five or so remain and more seem to close with each year. These cafés which were once part of the fabric of Bombay life are fading away steadily from the collective memory of the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All who know the Irani cafés nurture treasured stories of them. They were places for bunking off school, for bashful teenage trysts, for debating politics and cinema with the idealistic bravery of youth, for escaping – deeply – into a book, accompanied by endless chai. The Irani Cafés were lovely places for growing up – and for growing old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And they were important places too. In a city all too busy making harsh social judgments, the Irani Cafés were truly shared spaces. Anyone could find refuge here for the few paise it took to buy a cup of chai &#8211; Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Parsi. The poor student, the famous artist, the tired taxi-wallah, even the hooker, shunned elsewhere. Differences leveled, tolerance a given. A city without these shared social spaces collapses into prejudice, dystopia and even violence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But sooner or later, for all the love that people have for them, the Irani Cafés may all be gone. Faded away, unnoticed, in the rush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our own small way, we thought we could contribute to the capture of memory. We already pay homage to the Irani Cafés through design and food, but we thought we could go further and document and preserve actual recollections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We gathered stories from those who know and love the Irani Cafés – guests at Dishoom, the owners of the remaining cafés, others in Bombay and London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We then literally baked these stories onto eighty of our plates (at 850C).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now – if you come to Dishoom in Shoreditch, you’ll notice stories on the plates. You can read about marriage proposals, about cantankerous owners, about rotis so good they had to be flown across continents, about double omelets and sweet chai. If you pause briefly, you may even feel a sense of how those moments – now passed forever – actually felt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed – we also invite you to look at the plates online in a <a href="http://platewallah.dishoom.com">gallery,</a> and share your own Irani café stories, if you have them. We’ll bake the best of these stories into our café in Shoreditch too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s truly our honour and privilege to be doing the important work of preserving the memory and telling the stories of the Irani Cafés of 20<sup>th</sup> century Bombay.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[CELEBRATING DIWALI IN BOMBAY (AND LONDON)]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bombay. This magnificent yet (at times) mad &#8220;maximum city&#8221; is heaving with people of all backgrounds, races and religions. A city groaning under the weight of its own success and seductive appeal, a city hurtling towards its real and imagined destinations at breakneck speed. All the while bearing the bulk of its 20 million residents, each one clinging on for dear life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the midst of this perfect storm, Diwali provides an occasion to stop, take a pause for breath, gather one&#8217;s loved ones, and celebrate all that is good in the world. With its symbolism of <a title="It’s Diwali (again!)" href="http://dishoom.com/its-diwali-again/" target="_blank">awakening, new joy and hope, the beginning of a new year</a>, the festival of light brings people together in celebration, regardless of wealth or status, of race or background and even beliefs. Bombay is all people and all religions, and Bombay, as a city, celebrates Diwali with boundless passion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the days and weeks before Diwali, the excitement and gaiety flickers through Bombay like electricity. It gently brings all the members of the family and community back together, much like an old <em>dadi</em> (grandmother) lovingly knitting a sweater, pulling at loose ends, tugging at the corners to reaffirm the ties that bind. Households embark on their annual frenzy of cleaning and tidying; each corner of the house is scrubbed bright; and the prized linen, crockery and silverware stored away for &#8216;best&#8217; are taken out with a flourish for Diwali &#8211; the most special of occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each ritual has its own sweet, nostalgic significance. But it is not about the size of the home; whether the trappings of Diwali are luxurious and brand-new or carefully preserved hand-me-downs; or whether the car in the garage is a Mercedes or a Maruti. What matters in every home, from the smallest slum dwelling to the grandest Malabar Hill mansion, is that come dusk, each window and door is left open, and earthen oil lamps are lit to welcome Lakshmi, Goddess of Wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day of Diwali dawns: <a title="Diwali – the Festival of Light" href="http://dishoom.com/diwali-the-festival-of-light/">the Diwali story</a> has been played out. The fearsome ten-headed demon Ravana has been defeated; Lord Rama and Hanuman are on their gloried return home, with Sita safely rescued from Ravana.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homes are sparkling clean. Dinner tables groan with the weight of food painstakingly prepared throughout the day. Platters are laden with sweets (and filched by small, sticky fingers!). Miniature earthen lamps with cotton wicks are dipped in ghee, and lit as the sun sets. And families dressed in silken Diwali finery gather around as the dusky skyline is illuminated by firecrackers. Sparklers, pinwheels, rockets, ladi bombs, mithai, colourful celebrations, fun and laughter… this is the picture of Diwali in so many homes in India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And this year, here in London, we would once again like to invite you to celebrate Diwali with us. We may not be in Bombay, but somehow we can all try and capture a little of its spirit and share it with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DIWALI AT DISHOOM &#8211; 2012</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On Sunday 11th November, we’ve teamed up with the <a href="http://southasianlitfest.com/">South Asian Literature Festival</a> to celebrate the wonderful stories behind Diwali with a fun-packed family day of face-painting, pavement art and storytelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dishoom’s spellbinding (and world-famous!) master storyteller Vayu Naidu will narrate the fabulous story of Rama, Sita and Hanuman. A tale of kidnapped princesses, daring and wonder, shape-shifting golden deer, chariots flying across skies, monkey gods leaping across oceans! Adults and children alike will be captivated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, bring your kids, your friends and yourselves and celebrate the Diwali story at Dishoom. Have a look at last year’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.304237236269431.94306.109165852443238&amp;type=3" target="_blank">Facebook album</a> to see all the fun that was had!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COVENT GARDEN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11am – 1pm</strong> – Pavement <strong>Rangoli</strong> and <strong>face-painting</strong> for kids and adults of all ages – transform yourself into a colourful character from the Diwali story or have your face decorated with a delicate design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>At 11.30am</strong> – Vayu Naidu, story-teller extraordinaire, tells the story of Diwali, princes, princesses and monkey gods! (roughly 45 mins)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SHOREDITCH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>At 4.30pm </strong>– a welcoming glass of Diwali Punch (or Chocolate Chai for the teetotallers and young ones)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>At 5pm</strong> – Vayu Naidu will give a second performance of the marvellous story of Diwali. (around 45 mins)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>At 6pm </strong>– <em>mithai</em> (Indian sweets) and sweet <em>paan</em> for all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make a reservation <a title="Reservations" href="http://dishoom.com/reservations/">here</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(There’s absolutely no charge for any of the special activities &#8211; all are welcome. Of course, you&#8217;re very welcome to eat with us too before or after the activities. You don’t have to reserve a table if you&#8217;d like to eat, but if there’s a large group of you it might be a good idea.)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DIWALI FEASTS &#8211; 2012</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the whole of Diwali period from Monday 5th November – Wednesday 15th November, we’re doing two <strong>special Diwali Feasts</strong>, one completely vegetarian and the other featuring our much-loved Dishoom Lobster Tail. And by popular demand, we’ve brought back the Dahi Puri and the Phaldari Kofta Ruby. Of course, since it&#8217;s Diwali, we&#8217;ll be serving everyone <em>mithai</em>, chocolate barfi, too.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[BEFORE I MOVED TO LONDON I WAS TOLD OFTEN HOW SIMILAR IT IS TO BOMBAY.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Locations made familiar in Bollywood films, Victoria carriages, a melting pot of communities&#8230; and for the days I felt homesick I had Wembley, Southall and Brick Lane. They said I would feel right at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I especially resisted Shoreditch for years. A lot of that had to do with constant invitations to test how authentic the &#8220;curry&#8221; is. And some had to do with the city&#8217;s coolerati constantly trying to put Shoreditch in a box (that it always triumphantly wriggled out of).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then three years ago, the day I stopped feeling homesick, I set out for Brick Lane. I braced myself for the assault of sweet shops, Bangladeshi curry smells and filthy streets, and instead lost my way to Arnold Circus. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the monsoon-like July afternoon or the sudden quiet that surrounded me, but for my first few minutes in Shoreditch I thought I was in Bombay&#8217;s Horniman Circle Gardens. I felt right at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In that instant I was back in the Bombay of 1992, walking through Horniman Circle to Cafe Mocambo, for my first ever chai at my first ever Irani Cafe, for my first ever date. I remember sitting on a bench in the little garden and asking Bombay to help settle my nerves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This garden in South Bombay really should not be the sanctuary it is&#8230; the Bombay Stock Exchange is a stone&#8217;s throw away, the city&#8217;s Mint isn&#8217;t far either, and one of Bombay&#8217;s busiest business districts &#8211; Fort/Fountain &#8211; kisses the edge of the gardens. And yet the labyrinth of streets that surround Horniman Circle are like caravans of calm, guiding weary visitors to hidden gems like Bombay Paperie, Cafe Mocambo, Jimmy Boy and Apoorva. Is the quiet out of reverence for the imposing Asiatic Library whose brilliant white steps lead into Horniman Circle? Or does Bombay herself need to stop for chai in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since that day, Arnold Circus has represented all that Horniman Circle does for me. A space to escape from the Suits, the clatter of Brick Lane, and the skyscrapers of the City. Lazy afternoons of ambling around the cafes and stores that weave their protective net around Arnold Circus have found a permanent place on my Greatest Hits of Memories playlist, that I often replay in my mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so London became what Bombay is. Both are cities you can get lost in to never be found; and yet find yourself over and over again. These are cities where destiny, loss and love are just round the corner. Maximum cities where anything is possible. Everything is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Thums Ups at Café Mocambo to Thums Up Flips at <a title="Shoreditch" href="http://dishoom.com/shoreditch/">Dishoom Shoreditch</a>, life seems to have started all over again. Thank you, Dishoom.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[On the Southbank (May 13th - Oct 4th 2011)]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sadly, the Chowpatty Beach Bar has now left the Southbank </strong>– <a title="Goodbye Dishoom Chowpatty Beach" href="http://dishoom.com/goodbye-dishoom-chowpatty-beach/"><strong>Read its obituary here</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> Dishoom brings Bombay&#8217;s famous Chowpatty Beach to the South Bank of London for a summer party&#8230;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Waterloo sunset. Pink sky, warm summer evening. Big Ben and the London Eye to the west, St Paul’s to the east. Strolling along to Southbank Centre, you see sand, bunting and hundreds of Londoners young and old, enjoying the Festival of Britain 60th anniversary celebrations.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>But then you hear the enchanting sound of Hindi music.You notice the spicy aroma of fresh Pau Bhaji. Chilled Thums Up bottles clink. Children chase balloons across the sand.You see a colourful old fishing boat, full of green coconuts, ready to be cut open and sipped from. Naughty Gola Ices look cool and tempting. Where did the old grey portakabin go? And who put this crazy Indian beach shack up on the Southbank?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It can all get a bit serious and gloomy can&#8217;t it? The cuts, the unemployment, the earthquakes, climate change. There hardly seems to be any good news, and it&#8217;s not been an easy time for us Londoners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But every now and again we have to let our collective hair down. Take a holiday. Lighten up. Do something we wouldn&#8217;t normally do. A little bit of fun and laughter makes all the difference in the world. It nourishes the soul.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This summer, the Southbank is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the original Festival of Britain, which was itself celebrated amidst the austerity of post-war reconstruction. There will be a big beach along the promenade (really!) with lots of bunting and Tracy Emin doing her first show for years, Ray Davis of the Kinks doing the Meltdown Festival and Vintage Goodwood relocating to the South Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And we wanted to do our bit as adopted Londoners. If an old Bombay Café strolled casually down to the beach (while perhaps on a mild acid trip), the result would be the Dishoom Chowpatty Beach Bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From early May to the beginning of October we&#8217;re taking you on a little summer holiday, right here in London. You&#8217;ll be able to kick off your flip flops, tuck into tasty Bombay food and sip refreshing tipples right here on the South Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And we&#8217;ve built it jugaad-style. Jugaad is a great word. It&#8217;s hindi for &#8216;making do&#8217; or &#8216;reusing&#8217; or &#8216;creative improvisation&#8217;. We&#8217;re actually already well into construction on the Southbank (go and have a look!) and we&#8217;re making do with what we can find. (Apparently, this is also called up-cycling). We&#8217;re using old materials, furnishings and decorations &#8211; brightly coloured barrels for stools, reclaimed railway sleepers as bench seating on the alfresco terrace, a bar made from recycled plastic bottles and walls erected using old tightly-rolled newspapers. There are even old freight pallets cladding the outside of the building. Look out for labels which tell you what things used to be&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enter the beach bar via an arched walkway festooned with thousands of multi-coloured used carrier bags (with some of yours if you follow our facebook page!). Faded portraits playfully subvert our more strait-laced home on St Martin’s Lane. We&#8217;ve also jazzed up the soundtrack. Our resident DJ was asked to create music which took Dishoom on a acid trip on Chowpatty Beach in 1965. (We actually haven&#8217;t heard the result yet&#8230;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The original Chowpatty beach in Bombay.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chowpatty beach is where all Bombay comes to snack and stroll. Every Bombayite has nostalgic memories of magical evenings with family and friends, enjoying the view of the Arabian Sea at dusk and the lights of the skyline across the bay.The ramshackle food stalls that pepper the beach are revered for serving the tastiest Pau Bhaji in India. Everyone has their favourite Gola-walla, who shaves ice from huge blocks, packs it onto a stick and douses it in delicious syrup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Gola-wallas at Dishoom Chowpatty beach will be serving authentic Gola flavours, alongside their playful (and naughty) twists.The rest of the drinks menu is also tempting &#8211; Bombay Pimm’s Summer Cup, Spiked Colaba Ice Tea, Classic Dishoom Chaijito, Beers, Wines, Prosecco and Pommery Pop Champagne served in baby bottles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also treat yourself to classic Bombay food, including Pau Bhaji, the Dishoom Frankie (freshly baked naan filled with spicy lamb mince), and what is almost an obsession in Bombay &#8211; the naughty Vada Pau, fried potatoes in a bun with homemade chilli chutneys – you could call it an Indian chip butty. And, we couldn&#8217;t do a menu without the  much-loved bacon naan roll &#8211; this time served all day. (Yes! All day!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, loosen that tie, roll up your trousers, bare those legs (they need the sun!) and join the party at Dishoom Chowpatty Beach.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A LITERARY DESTINATION FOR INDIANS AND TOURISTS]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Leopold&#8217;s café on Colaba is another Bombay institution. The wide shopfront on Colaba Causeway, one of the oldest and busiest roads in the city, opens up the large café to an expansive view of the street. Beggars beg, hawkers peddle counterfeit goods to the crowds of passing locals and tourists, and black and yellow taxis stuck in traffic honk, pointlessly. It’s a snapshot of vibrant, energetic, urban Bombay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gregory David Roberts famously wrote about Leopold’s in his book Shantaram, which was the essential backpacker accessory a few years ago. The main character used to sit there endlessly with his colourful cast of friends. The book recounts the story of Roberts himself, an Australian prison escapee who lived in the slums, where he established a health clinic, became a street soldier for the Bombay mafia, was thrown into Indian prison and then went on to fight with the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. Slightly crazy, but a fun and lively read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As in the book, Leo’s is almost always full, but it’s much better to be inside than outside. The high ceilings and buzzing fans provide welcome relief from the heat. The café chairs are just comfortable enough. The big old clock above the door and the aging mahogany trimmed mirrors even lend the café a distinguished air. Leo’s dates back to the 1870s, so it has earned the right to its shabby elegance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The customers are pretty diverse. Bombayites mix easily with tourists from all over the world. Hours are lost in people-watching. Business is conducted. Some suggest that Leo’s is a good place for less legitimate kinds of trade, but it’s just part of the fabric of Bombay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you ask, the waiters will point out the bullet holes in the walls and in the mirrors where the terrorists who took over the café for a day in 2008 left their mark. It was a traumatic day but a few days later, Leopold’s re-opened and resumed its rhythm.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[EVERY BOMBAYITE KNOWS BADEMIYA.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When we go to Bombay, we always go to Bademiya. Maybe on the first night we arrive. I’m not sure why, but it helps take the edge off the jet-lag. Some may well argue that there are better grills in Amritsar and Lahore. A few others may point to Ayub’s or Baghdadi’s. But for sheer Bombay tastiness, fun and atmosphere, you can’t beat Bademiya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is located behind the sumptuous Taj Hotel and close to the Gateway of India on the tip of South Bombay. By day this road sleeps. However, from early evening, the atmosphere changes. Yellow streetlamps and shop-front neon illuminate the street and Bademiya Alley comes alive until the small hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tables are crammed together on the uneven pavement, though there isn’t a spare seat to be seen. The delicious aroma from the sizzling grill floats over the crowd. BMWs and Toyotas jostle for space at either end of the street, people eating from the plates on their bonnets. Harried waiters rush around taking orders while delivering plates piled with searing hot sheekh kababs. Everyone knows Bademiya for its amazing grilled food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only time Bademiya has ever closed up, is for the forty-eight hours after posh Bombay was held hostage by terrorists at the Taj hotel in 2008. But it was quickly back to business as usual. Regulars have included the actor Amitabh Bachchan, the famous artist MF Husain plus almost all of the kitchen staff at the nearby Taj hotel (some of whom will be in the Dishoom kitchen). Hilary Clinton allegedly wanted to visit Bademiya but her security detail didn’t let her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is no more than a stall on the pavement around the flaming grill. However, it is world-famous for its succulent sheekh kababs, feisty lamb chops and juicy paneer, all served straight off the grill with amazing speed. To the side, a tireless man wearing a chef’s hat stands beside a hot round dome.  He tosses dough into the air, catches it, stretches it over the dome, and pulls a light and delicious roomali roti off the dome onto a serving plate. His hands are a blur as they move, making these ‘handkerchief’ breads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bademiya opened for business in 1940 (when Gandhiji was still busy persuading the British to leave India) by a 17 year old immigrant to Bombay, Mohammed Yaseen, with 20 rupees in his pocket. People say that when he grew a beard, regulars started calling him Bademiya, which means ‘old man’ or ‘elder’. Over the years his much-loved grill has become a Bombay institution. And a Dishoom inspiration.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A LOT HAS HAPPENED BETWEEN THESE WALLS.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Britannia Café is a lovely piece of vintage Bombay which is slowly disappearing. It was built in the early twenties by George Wittet, the architect who also built the Gateway of India to greet George V on his visit to Bombay. We were recently at Britannia, sipping Thums Up in its faded elegance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Boman Kohinoor is the owner of the café. He ambles over to us and addresses us. “How old do you think I am?” he asks. We study him. He is wiry and lean and peers at us through his thick glasses. He gives us a clue. “I’m as old as this place.” Finally he tells us. “I was born in 1923. The same year as Britannia opened.” He says with a wide, wise smile. He shares his name with the famous diamond claimed by the British to crown Queen Victoria the Empress of India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next to us a pair of posh ladies take tea. They talk in the refined English of upper class Bombay. On our other side is a table of students taking a very late breakfast. They are eating hot buttered toast and drinking <span id="GRmark_48f8d7331a43939ca381ccddcf19001bbb8123fa_chai:0" class="GRcorrect">chai</span>. They manage to devour their food hungrily and chatter loudly at the same time. On another table <span id="GRmark_aef255d6038ccb6d95ef5d0dea5b9fd41b241727_are:0" class="GRcorrect">are</span> a pair of earnest backpackers, who have probably read about Britannia in their dog-eared copy of the Lonely Planet Guide. They look excited to be here.</p>
<p>Britannia looks like it always did. Fans turn slowly under high ceilings. Bentwood chairs are reflected in stained mirrors, hung amongst ancestors’ faded sepia portraits. Exposed wiring droops across flaking blue walls. The image of a classic Bombay Café. It’s not that hot yet.  But as the temperature rises, Britannia will become a haven from the city heat. As it has been, for many years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. <span id="GRmark_f39689ab740e0e28f0ef5fd755b55a5a3f8926ac_Kohinoor’s:0" class="GRcorrect">Kohinoor’s</span> pride is tempered with sadness. “Fifty years ago there were hundreds of these cafés. Now there are only thirty. Our children just don’t care. They go abroad, to make money. When I’m gone, they tell me they’ll close Britannia.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The berry <span id="GRmark_6b161940781ac9965491d2d91bd5fee982de4d48_pulao:0" class="GRcorrect">pulao</span> arrives – a dish still spoken of by many Bombayites. Mr. Kohinoor takes the plate from the waiter and places it on our table for us to share. “Enjoy your food” he says. He pauses, smiles again, and returns slowly to his rightful place in the chair by the front door.</p>
