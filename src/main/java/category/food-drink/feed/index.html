		<description><![CDATA[CHILLI GARLIC CRAB]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few hours of sun cast a pink hue over the Bombay sky. October lights dance across the bay. A veritable cocktail of spices floats in the air as noises from the nearby food stalls give visitors the promise of quick, hot and delicious food. It is a magical evening here on Chowpatty Beach.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to witness such a thing, especially during the Diwali season. All kinds of people from all over Bombay come to this spot, to snack and stroll. At this time of year all the clothes are just that bit more colourful. Young and old jumble together visiting their favourite spots for Pau Bhaji or Gola. Everybody eats outdoors and everyone shares in the moment.</p>
<p>The normal, frenetic pace of life that defines the city is forgotten on evenings like this. No matter how busy one’s day might have been, time spent at Chowpatty Beach reminds us to slow down and enjoy the company of loved ones, and that good food is never far away. We can always find the time to appreciate a particularly delicious Vada Pau, a rewardingly crunchy Bhel or a sweetly invigorating fresh sugarcane juice.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are times when we are granted more than just a moment to pause. Diwali, the festival of light, offers all of us a chance to stop, reflect and remember all that there is to be thankful for in the world. Amidst the celebrations of light, colour and the <a title="Diwali at Dishoom – 2011" href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-at-dishoom/">wonderful story</a>, and the constant crackle of fireworks, the whole family comes together to indulge in an abundance of delicious, traditional khana. From mithai to masala chai, every dish is served with love and care, and family, friends, and neighbours all share their delight in a joyful, communal pause.</p>
<p>We absolutely love Diwali. So, this year, we held a special event inside the Granary Building at King’s Cross (near our <a title="IN WHICH A YOUNG IRANI OPENS A CAFÉ IN A GODOWN BEHIND VICTORIA TERMINUS, C. 1928" href="http://www.dishoom.com/in-which-a-young-irani-opens-a-cafe-in-a-godown-behind-victoria-terminus-c-1928/">new café</a> – opening in a few weeks!). It was great fun &#8211; check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.985547848138363.1073741832.109165852443238&amp;type=1">photo album</a>. And in the Shoreditch and Covent Garden cafés, Chef Naved has devised two special Diwali dishes of Phaldari Kofta Ruby (veg) and Chilli Garlic Crab.</p>
<p>Naved has even kindly shared his own recipe for the Chilli Garlic Crab (below), so – if you can’t make it to in to see us &#8211; at least you can share in our celebrations at home!</p>
<h2>CHILLI GARLIC CRAB</h2>
<p>Whenever we go to Bombay, we stop in to Mahesh Lunch Home for some brilliant seafood – and they inspired us to create this dish.</p>
<p><em>Serves two, pretty generously</em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>300g fresh crab, off the shell</p>
<p>60g butter</p>
<p>40ml refined vegetable oil</p>
<p>A large knob of ginger, chopped</p>
<p>8-10 medium cloves garlic – be generous!</p>
<p>Pinch of chopped green chilli</p>
<p>Handful of chopped dill leaves</p>
<p>Generous handful of chopped coriander</p>
<p>6-8 whole spring onions, roughly chopped</p>
<p>20 black peppercorns, freshly crushed in a pestle and mortar, or in a teatowel with a rolling pin</p>
<p>Lime for squeezing</p>
<p>Salt – to taste</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<p>In a heavy-bottomed pan, gently heat the butter and oil together. Add the chopped garlic and sauté until golden brown.</p>
<p>Add the freshly crushed pepper, chopped ginger, and the chopped spring onion bulbs, and saute lightly for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Add the crab meat and sauté for 2-3 minutes, adding a little water if the crab begins to stick to the pan.</p>
<p>Add all of the remaining ingredients, including the green stems of and toss for for further 2 minutes. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lime and serve with Malabar paratha or soft pau (Bombay buns).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The origins of Haleem are deeply rooted in history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Some time ago, we made Haleem our Chef&#8217;s special at Dishoom Covent Garden. Of course, we&#8217;d served it before in other forms, usually around Eid; and we were always touched by the reverence in which this traditional dish is held. Our Executive Chef-walla, Naved Nasir, explains why Haleem has found a home on our menu.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">****</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I love to truly understand and appreciate the origins of a dish, and learn how communities have adapted a recipe over time to make that dish unique to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe Haleem is so special because it has been around for so long, though its exact heritage is uncertain. It&#8217;s believed that this was originally an Arabic delicacy and was served for centuries in the royal palaces of Saudi Arabia. The story goes that it was first introduced to the Hyderabadi State in India by the Nizam rulers. They were known for eating a variety of rich foods, as their cooks used to prepare a variety of aromatic delicacies such as biryani, kababs and of course, haleem. It then slowly gained in popularity among the Hyderabadi community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even today Hyderabad is famous for selling its ‘Hyderabadi Haleem’ &#8211; which has recognised geographical indication status &#8211; at places such as Pista House. They’re known for exporting internationally to places such as Dubai, and it’s not uncommon for Bollywood types to place an order when the craving hits them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I was a child, I remember first trying a dish similar to Haleem called Kichdha, another authentic Hyderabadi speciality. After the first mouthful I became addicted to it! It consists of lamb, lentils and wheat, but it differs in texture because you notice the visibility of each grain. The lamb was so succulent… it’s funny how the first taste of something can become a lasting memory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cooking process of Haleem is very lengthy, and it&#8217;s not easy to cook to perfection at home. For around 8 hours, we let the wheat, lamb and lentils simmer with precise quantities of coriander, turmeric, cumin and many other aromatic spices. Then the ingredients are pounded to intertwine and infuse the spices, release the flavour, and create a thick, smooth texture, almost a savoury porridge. The ginger, fried onions, and chillies provide a certain crunch and texture that compliments the consistency – and try dipping in our sesame-onion seed naan – <em>aap ko pasand aiye ga</em> (you’ll love it!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Haleem is most special to me as a dish that brings people together &#8211; it’s commonly eaten at wedding celebrations, events and religious occasions such as Ramadan. You may have heard of Ashura, the tenth day of Muharram in the Islamic calendar – it commemorates the death of the grandson of Prophet Mohammad. To mark this occasion, in Mumbra, Dhongri and Mughal Masgid in Bombay, Haleem is cooked in large copper vessels on the roadsides and handed to everyone after the processions. It&#8217;s a simple gesture, but it creates a lovely spirit amongst the whole community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Dishoom, we want to continue this tradition of sharing the joy of Haleem. It has many rich, energising and nutritious ingredients, but it’s the love and care put into the making of the dish which creates the true flavour. And most of all I&#8217;m glad to see our guests &#8211; Muslims, Hindus, Christians and Parsis alike &#8211; enjoying this dish as it truly deserves to be enjoyed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">****</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Haleem is served at <a title="Covent Garden" href="http://dishoom.com/covent-garden/">Dishoom Covent Garden</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A Limited Edition
7th October - 2nd November 2013]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi. Lady Day and Prez. Bun Maska and Chai. There are some things in life so perfectly matched – such winning combinations – that you wonder quite what anyone did before they came along.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people thought we&#8217;d been at the <em>bhang</em> again when – long back – we aired the idea of serving bacon in a naan bread. You&#8217;re <em>paagal</em>, they said. A fool&#8217;s errand, scorned others. Why mess with a classic? It can&#8217;t be improved. And what the devil do Indians know about bacon? Etc&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And yet we had a hunch. A vision. A needling urge to bring a bit of Bombay and a bit of London closer together. Arduous (really!) rounds of bacon tastings ensued. Endless batches of dough were pounded. Forearms were singed in the tandoor. We faced agonising decisions over condiments. And then, finally, we had something we were proud to serve you. And – we can shyly admit – over time, the Bacon Naan Roll has garnered something of a following. <a href="http://marinaoloughlin.tumblr.com/post/1470326928/thing-of-loveliness-this-is-the-breakfast-bacon">Marina</a> called it &#8216;a thing of loveliness&#8217; – even &#8216;GAWJUSS&#8217; – and Time Out listed it in their <a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/the-100-best-dishes-in-london-2012-meat">Top 10 Meat Dishes</a>. It could well be the most tweeted-about bacon sandwich in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We take bacon direct from the char-grill and place it in a freshly baked naan, with the slightly genius combination of chilli-tomato jam, cream cheese and herbs. As far as we know, it&#8217;s the only bacon sandwich in London (and possibly, the world) where the bread is baked to order: each naan is cooked within seconds in the searingly hot tandoor ovens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And earlier this year, we asked the question – if bacon and naan are so damn good together – then what if we got hold of <em>the best bacon money can buy?</em> It stands to reason that this would be nothing short of phenomenal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>And thus, we introduce you to the (limited edition) Ginger Pig Bacon Naan Roll.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a short time only, in addition to our regular bacon naan roll, you can order a version with bacon from acclaimed rare breed specialists, The Ginger Pig. Streaky bacon from Tamworth, Berkshire, Old Spot and Plum Pudding pigs, dry-cured for five days with rock salt and demerara sugar, then cold-smoked over oak chips. It&#8217;s a stronger, tastier, saltier bacon. A bit more badass, if you will. Served up in our naan, it&#8217;s a simple plate of awesomeness, all for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>We introduced the Ginger Pig Bacon Naan Roll as a Limited Edition, but it was so well received we put in on the menu for good. Breakfast is served between 8am and 11.30am Monday-Friday, and between 9am and 12pm Saturday and Sunday. <a title="Reservations" href="http://dishoom.com/reservations/">Click here to book</a>.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">About The Ginger Pig</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ginger Pig began life over 20 years ago with a near-derelict farmhouse, an accidental farmer and three Tamworth pigs. They now run more than 3,000 acres of farm and moorland and work with a group of like-minded farmers to supply their London butchery shops and a handful of restaurants. The Ginger Pig’s breeds include the ginger Tamworth, the black Berkshire, the Old Spot and the Plum Pudding – a Tamworth/ Berkshire cross which produces pigs that are orange with black spots. Sadly there are fewer than 500 registered breeding Tamworth and Berkshire pigs left in the UK, and they remain at risk on the Rare Breeds Survival Trust watch list. The work of The Ginger Pig is helping to make sure we don’t lose these these heritage breeds forever.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[RAAN IS THE STUFF OF LEGEND]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Quite literally. The story goes that the dish can be traced to Alexander the Great &#8211; whom Indians call Sikandar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sikandar captured the Indian king, Paurava of Takshila, after a tough and bloody battle. Even in defeat, the proud and valorous Paurava, his head held high, asked that he be treated befitting his status as a king. Sikandar, impressed with his adversary, released him, and they became friends. The barbecued whole leg of lamb was the centrepiece of a banquet laid on to celebrate the new friendship of Sikandar and Paurava, and hence the dish became known as Sikandari Raan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over time, the Raan has journeyed from being rustic, hearty fare to being a rather exclusive and refined dish enjoyed only in the most costly restaurants. But this felt all wrong to us. Raan shouldn&#8217;t just be the preserve of fine dining. We needed to take it back to its roots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By putting this on our menu &#8211; and even more so by putting it in a bun &#8211; we wanted to democratise this very special dish and make it much more accessible. It&#8217;s a proper feast for every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the Raan (which literally means &#8220;leg&#8221;), a whole leg of lamb is rubbed first with a dry marinade of salt and Kashmiri red chilli, and then second with ginger and garlic. It is marinated overnight, then submerged and braised in a juice of whole spices (including star anise, cinnamon and bay leaf) in malt vinegar and slow-cooked for several hours. We skewer the braised meat then grill it over hot coals until it&#8217;s nicely roasted (basting as we go, to keep it moist). Finally, it&#8217;s pulled off the bone in loose chunks, and the tender meat is dressed with a spices, butter and fresh lime for a final hit of rich juiciness, or juicy richness. Either way, it&#8217;s very rich, and very juicy and you&#8217;ll mourn a little when you take your final bite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the Lamb Raan Bun, we put a generous pile of Raan into a strong sourdough bun, along with pickles and onions, and serve it with sali crisp-chips and deep fried green chillies. Pick it up with both hands and take a properly big bite. Juices may run down your chin. Then, carefully, take an occasional nibble of the fried chilli to cast a warm glow over the whole meal. Wash it down with our deliciously hoppy Dishoom IPA, from Hackney&#8217;s Beavertown Brewery, brewed to stand up to the strong flavours in the meat. And it will totally hit that spot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We serve the Lamb Raan Bun only at Dishoom Shoreditch. But for the first time ever, we will be serving the Lamb Raan Bun in the wild, outside its natural home &#8211; at <a href="http://wefeast.co.uk">FEAST</a>. Come and see us as part of this spectacular banquet event on on 7-10 March 2013 at Tobacco Docks in Wapping, and taste it for yourself&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[THE HOTTEST EVENT OF 2012]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Chilli. Mexican. Or maybe Tex-Mex. Not really Bombay, or indeed Indian, at all. So when we were first asked to take part in the UK &#8220;<a href="http://www.chillistandoff.com/">Chilli Standoff</a>&#8220;, which took place last Saturday 17th November, we had to put our (slightly dirty and dog-eared) thinking topis on. But we quickly decided it looked such damn good fun that we simply had to be the Pete Sellers at this particular party.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And so, Chef Naved set to work in the kitchen. A bit of keema here, a few rajma there&#8230; liberal amounts of spices, onions, fresh lime, garlic, ginger&#8230; and as it turns out, it wasn&#8217;t such a leap of faith after all. Served with a sprinkle of crispy fried onions, a twist of lime, fried green <em>mirchi</em> and some toasted, buttered <em>pau </em>bun, it wouldn&#8217;t have felt out of place on our menu at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the end &#8211; we came third. A podium finish! Not quite the first place we were hoping for, but against such food legends as <a href="http://www.luckychipuk.com/">Lucky Chip</a> (1st) &#8211; with their slow-cooked chilli with bone marrow and vanilla butter &#8211; and <a href="https://twitter.com/WillYumsCoUk">Will Yates</a>&#8216; (2nd) complex rare-breed chilli (stalwart Will was undaunted by a potentially broken hand), third place was a proud achievement. (We were just a touch sad that Salim did not get to do his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10100518005272318&amp;set=vb.109165852443238&amp;type=3&amp;theater">victory dance</a>.) And even before the results were announced, it was already a first-class day out, in the company of some of the best names in the food business (Gizzi Erskine, Angela Harnett, Tom Parker-Bowles&#8230;). All proceedings were helped along by plenty of ale (from Texas &#8211; or <a href="http://www.beavertownbrewery.com/">Hackney</a>), a chota-peg of tequila, chocolate-chilli gelato, and a meringue &#8220;kiss&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(A great &#8211; and somewhat more objective! &#8211; write-up of the event can be found <a href="http://asouthernbellein.com/2012/11/uk-chilli-stand-off-2012/">here</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And really &#8211; what could we have called it, but <strong>Slumdog Chillionaire</strong>? For anyone that&#8217;s still hankering after it &#8211; you can recreate it at home. And we may even serve it up as a special one day soon.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[RECENTLY OVERHEARD AT DISHOOM...
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Brian (still daydreaming of his recent, inaugural visit to Bombay):</em> &#8220;You know what we need to really crack a Bombay Breakfast? Akuri. Oh man, that scrambled egg stuff made my stomach sit up and sing. Ey ji! Oh ji! Ey ji oh ji lo ji sunoji! Main hoon manmoji!&#8221; <em>(drifts into reverie, humming to himself and tapping his feet)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Naved, wonderingly:</em> &#8220;Accha! Choo mantar! There is magic in this here masala!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Kavi, imperious:</em> &#8220;Hot grills on a bed of cool salad? Na, I&#8217;m just not feeling it any more&#8230; these salads need to rock. I want ZINGY, I want SEXY, I want EXCITING. I want, like, <em>fruit</em> in my salad&#8230; give me pomegranate seeds, <em>yaar</em>!&#8221; (camp flounce, twirls cane).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Carl, poring over stacks of 19th-century mixology tomes:</em> “By jove&#8230; I have it&#8230; I do believe there <strong>is</strong> a way to make a really, really great classic cocktail using <a title="Classic drink, barmy twist – the Thums Up Flip" href="http://dishoom.com/classic-drink-barmy-twist-thums-up-flip/">our beloved Thums Up</a>!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this might suggest (quite rightly) that we&#8217;re&#8230; well, a bit barmy. Unorthodox, to put it mildly. Full of crazy ideas, half-baked in the tandoor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But then again, there&#8217;s something about the summer that inspires a desire for change. And sometimes the barmiest ideas are the best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s especially true when they&#8217;re tempered with a sturdy heritage, a dash of nostalgia and a generous helping of love and care, to get things just right. So, without further ado, we introduce you to a host of <strong>new summer dishes</strong> – which are already cosying up to the old favourites on our menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Click the links to see the photos on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dishoomlondon">Facebook</a>!)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ve created some mouthwateringly good new salads, perfect for a delicious light lunch:<strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=462386743787812&amp;set=a.462386010454552.125923.109165852443238&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Paneer &amp; Mango</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=462386100454543&amp;set=a.462386010454552.125923.109165852443238&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Chicken &amp; Pomegranate</a>, </strong>or<strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=462387123787774&amp;set=a.462386010454552.125923.109165852443238&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Prawn &amp; Pomelo</a>.</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[ Our new Thums Up Flip]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow. Thums Up. It&#8217;s kind of a Bombay institution, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s one of those glorious things that never fails to sweep us back in time and conjure up treasured childhood memories of the homeland. Distinctive, tangy, hyper-sweet, the taste reminds us of greedily quenching our thirst after a long afternoon&#8217;s cricket practice. Meandering home from school, rationing a prized bottle between best friends. Balmy evening strolls on Chowpatty Beach, rapidly-warming bottle in one hand, Pau Bhaji in the other. It&#8217;s not Thunder you can taste, it&#8217;s pure nostalgia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, there was never really any question that we have Thums Up at Dishoom. It&#8217;s part of our Bombay DNA. And we&#8217;ve been faithfully serving Thums Up to delighted Desis – and getting our non-Desi friends hooked on it – ever since we opened our doors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It would be fair to say that another part of our DNA is being curious, or even a bit barmy; asking odd questions that nobody has ever thought to ask before, like &#8220;<a title="The Dishoom Chowpatty Beach Bar" href="http://dishoom.com/the-dishoom-chowpatty-beach-bar-may-sep/">What would happen if an old Bombay Cafe took a trip down to Chowpatty Beach circa 1965 while on a mild acid trip?</a>&#8220;, or &#8220;<a title="Naughty Christmas Chai" href="http://dishoom.com/naughty-christmas-chai/">I wonder whether Masala Chai tastes good with Baileys?</a>&#8221; (answer: of course it does!). And one day recently our Daru-wallah Carl pondered the question, &#8220;How can we make a really great vintage cocktail using&#8230;.Thums Up?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sounds more than a bit silly, right? But we just knew that if we could make it work, it would be like that positively rousing moment in Lagaan where Bhuvan hits the winning six, and stops his village paying tax forever. So our daru-walla Carl (who is really very talented – think of him as Aamir Khan in this particular analogy) set to work. We dabbled, we dipped and we tasted and tested, and the answer to that particularly bonkers conundrum is our new Thums Up Flip.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now Flips are about as classic as they come. The recipe was first written down by Jerry Thomas in 1862, and today the drink is redolent of glamorous 1920s cocktail parties; all smoking jackets, crystal glasses and elegant jewellery. And Flips are not an easy drink to perfect – coming from an era that sanctified purity and perfection in its cocktail-making. But done right, they&#8217;re gobsmackingly good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For our Flip, we took inspiration from Thums Up (or more accurately, a home-made syrup made by carefully reducing the &#8216;raw&#8217; liquid to intensify its Thums-uppiness!) and combined it with one of our &#8216;national&#8217; spirits &#8211; Johnnie Walker Black Label Whisky. We then added a touch of double cream, an egg and a dash of cinnamon bitters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may not sound the likeliest of combinations, but trust us – it&#8217;s damn good. The individually heavy flavours work together to create a drink that&#8217;s light, delicate and subtly balanced – not to mention absolutely delicious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ll be serving this particular blend of awesomeness from <strong>Monday 21st May</strong>, when our revamped menu gets launched (more on this to follow&#8230;). Keep an eye out for passworded freebies and tasters on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dishoomlondon">Facebook</a>&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing we haven&#8217;t decided yet is the name – so Dishoom-wallas, we&#8217;d like your help! Is it a good old <strong>Thums Up Flip</strong>, or the racier-sounding <strong>Black &#8216;n&#8217; Thunder</strong> [i.e. Johnnie Walker Black Label and the Thums Up slogan &#8216;Taste the Thunder&#8217;]? Or do you have a better suggestion? Let us know what you think by posting below!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS. If whisky isn&#8217;t your thing – fear not – we&#8217;re also adding a very nostalgic Thums Up Float with vanilla ice cream to the menu next week&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Christmas Turkey by Dishoom]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Christmas Turkey. Now be honest. Does the thought of it fill you with excitement? Does it make your taste buds stand to attention?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Probably not. Everyone seems to have a memory of a Christmas dinner that turned out appallingly – insipid meat, flabby sprouts – and the mere idea of cooking a roast fowl can send some people into a decline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So naturally, we felt it was our responsibility to rescue Dishoom-wallas from this pit of turkey despair. A noble mission to turn this uninspiring meat into something amazing. Something that friends would squabble over the scraps of. A Bombay Party in your mouth, so to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of our absolute favourite Indian dishes is <em>Raan</em>, a whole leg of lamb, slow-cooked until the meat is so tender it’s falling off the bone. Much-celebrated and more than a little lavish, and therefore quite fitting for Christmas. And in a slightly inspired (read crazy) move we decided to try it with turkey instead &#8211; and the results were absolutely phenomenal. Our chef Naved Nasir could actually be a genius. Perhaps a superhero, like in that new Sharukh Khan movie. That&#8217;s going a bit far, but you get the idea…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike a traditional roast, we marinate the meat and cook it slowly over a whole day to keep maximum moisture and flavour. We cover the turkey leg with a dry rub of salt and chilli followed by ginger and garlic paste, then allow it to rest and absorb the flavours. The marinated meat is braised over several hours in a rich stock spiced with star anise, black cardamom and bay leaves, before being grilled over charcoal. Finally, it is tossed with butter, lime and black pepper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rich, moist and packed with flavour, Flaming Turkey Raan is the antidote to every disappointing Christmas dinner you’ve ever had&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And let’s not forget the accompaniments – the turkey comes with a fiery-sweet chutney made with cranberries and red chillies. And zingy Bombay Potatoes and Masala Winter Greens round off an altogether pretty spectacular dish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And no matter how full you feel, it will be impossible to resist finishing off your feast with a glass of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Naughty Christmas Chai" href="http://dishoom.com/naughty-christmas-chai/">Naughty Chai</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So this Christmas say no to dull-as-dishwater dinners, and come and try a <a title="CHRISTMAS FEASTS" href="http://www.dishoom.com/christmas-feasts/">Bombay Christmas feast</a> in London.</p>
