		<description><![CDATA[Back here in the Permit Room again. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again, dear reader, I’m back here. I am the weary, be-stubbled regular propping up one end of the bar in the Permit Room at the same time every year. I have a burra peg of something stiff at my elbow. If they&#8217;d let you smoke in here, I&#8217;d be making my way slowly through the pack. It&#8217;s been a long year. I feel depleted and consumed. Nothing left in the tank.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve begun to make friends with 2015. Fifteen, you old bastard. You truly were the best of times and the worst of times. For myriad reasons, you brought with you twelve of the toughest, fullest months. Weeks that were hard, and days that could only be dealt with one at a time. And yet, sitting here on the threshold of one year and the next, sorting through the events in my head, I&#8217;m beginning to discern the lessons you were teaching.</p>
<p>We lost a family member this year. A life made unfairly, senselessly short, the grief hard. But we also experienced the smiling kindness and cheerfully unshakeable courage of someone dealing with unspeakable pain. The strength and resilience of children, the unyielding love of family. The echoes that she leaves behind sound like gentle laughter, they sound like a love of life. The twinkle in her eye somehow outlasts the tears in ours. It is humbling; cached within the intense sadness of passing, there are precious – and joyful – lessons on how to live.</p>
<p>Of course,’15 carried with it other less intense moods too, for which I’m grateful. In Dishoom’s world, you, dear patron, continued to allow us to look after you, leaving with your wallet slightly lighter and your stomach slightly heavier than when you arrived; and perhaps with your spirit a touch refreshed. You let us serve you in this way and we give you sincere, humble and heartfelt thanks; for this is our livelihood.</p>
<p>In ’15, we launched a fourth Dishoom, on Kingly Street. This time our imagination wandered into the 1960s; we became the <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/introducing-dishoom-carnaby/" target="_blank">handsome young Irani in London</a>, returning to Bombay on hearing news of his father’s passing. The result was Dishoom Carnaby in which we explored Bombay of the period, so rich in its architectural and cultural detail. We sought out and made friends with the (actual, and lovely) people our handsome Irani would have known had he been a real person. Stalwarts such as Farrukh, Dolly, Padmini, Reynold, Nissim and, of course, the indomitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha_Puthli" target="_blank">Asha</a> became a part of our life. (Asha, by the way, is a living legend who can refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" target="_blank">Andy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger" target="_blank">Mick</a> by their first names.)</p>
<p>We also discovered that when the music of the Beatles and the Stones snuck past the walls of conservative Bombay in the sixties, kids picked up their guitars and started calling themselves ‘Beat’ bands. At the same time British groups were exploring mystic exotic India and her musical (and chemical!) delights. We became interested (obsessed) with this scene and, consulting with our new friend Sidharth Bhatia and our old friend Rob Wood, we actually managed to release an album, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/music/slip-disc/" target="_blank">Slip-Disc: Dishoom’s Bombay London Grooves</a>. Our hearts were lifted when Mojo gave our album 4 stars, Uncut rated it 8/10 and the good people over at BBC radio kept talking about it and playing it. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts for lending your ears to listen to the result of our (mis)adventures!</p>
<p>Beyond the boundaries of Dishoom, though, the world had a slightly disturbing quality. We’ve previously written in these pages of our strong belief in the need to create shared spaces, to break down barriers, to celebrate difference rather than judge it. More than ever, though, it seems that the worst are full of passionate intensity and that the best lack conviction. The moronic and lethal prejudices of extremists (whether Daesh or Donald) provide the warlike drumbeat to which events seem bound to dance. Reasonable and kind voices are at risk of being drowned out by the intolerant din.</p>
<p>One thing that Daesh, Donald and their kind have in common is that they see the world as binary. Us and them. Black and white. They thrive on polarity and conflict. Daesh talks often about the ‘<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/20/isis-binary-struggle-grey-zone-jihadism" target="_blank">grey zone</a>’. This grey zone is a place in which Muslims and non-Muslims co-exist peacefully. For Daesh it’s anathema.</p>
<p>I, for one, whole-heartedly want to live in the grey zone, where we all rub up against each other. It’s a messy shared space, to be sure, but it’s colourful and joyous. The way to fight extremism, or to react to the tragic nihilistic attacks in Paris (and elsewhere, for that matter) is not to shrink or dilute the grey zone, as Donald, Marine and others would have us do, but to celebrate it, defend it, and indeed to deepen it and expand it.</p>
<p>As you may have figured out, we work pretty hard to make Dishoom a first-class grey zone. Irani Cafés were quite possibly the original Bombay grey zones. We’re not able to fix things outside our walls but we can make sure that within our walls, the world is as it should be. In Dishoom, we really like serving food cooked in Parsi, Muslim, Hindu and Christian traditions, and we do it deliberately and self-consciously. We like celebrating <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/" target="_blank">Holi</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/eid-al-fitr/" target="_blank">Eid</a>, <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/diwali-and-ramayana/" target="_blank">Diwali</a> and Christmas. We have a strong view that mixing it up is a Good Thing. There is truly no greater pleasure than in bringing people together to celebrate each other’s cultures. I can’t think of a single reason not to do this. In fact, I’d go further; in today’s political climate, we must all do this. I think we’d be barmy not to.</p>
<p>One of the best things we’ve ever done at Dishoom had its origins in June this year. A group of us were sitting around a table replete with food (which is, as you can imagine, not an uncommon event at Dishoom). We were discussing Ramadan. Our group was composed of Hindus, a less-than-conscientious Christian, a Muslim and an aspiring Buddhist. Most of us had known that charity was one of the foundations of Islam, but we learnt that the holy time of Ramadan is particularly associated with giving to those less fortunate than yourself. Our food-laden table was beautiful, but in that context it gave us pause for thought. We decided that our ‘zakat’ (or charity) for the month of Ramadan would be to feed two children in need for every meal we served. We put this into place and worked with the delightful people at Magic Breakfast and Akshaya Patra – and in the end we were able to donate funds for <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/ramadan-the-month-of-giving/" target="_blank">160,000 meals</a> to be fed to children who would otherwise go hungry.</p>
<p>A short time later, we were discussing Diwali and the Hindu new year, which is a very special time for us Hindus. Again, we discussed that we should surely be contributing to the wider world (our ever-replete table being a reliable reminder of our good fortune). Someone came up with the idea that we should, from Diwali, make our Ramadan ‘zakat’ a permanent feature of what we do at Dishoom. It just made sense. It’s surely a tragedy that in our world children still go hungry. So, from this Diwali, we pledged to feed a hungry child for each guest we serve at Dishoom.</p>
<p>I’m prouder of this than almost anything else that I’ve been involved in. So far this year, we’ve donated over a quarter of a million meals for children in India and in East London. As I think back to how we as a group were moved to do this, it feels right; Hindus, Christians, Muslims and others feeding needy children in the name of Islam for Ramadan and then making this a permanent part of Dishoom from the Hindu new year.</p>
<p>So ’15 you old bastard, my burra peg is almost drained dry. Writing your elegy is helping me to come to terms with your despair and your hope, your weeping and your laughter. I’ve blinked back a few tears, but I’m smiling.</p>
<p>I know beyond all doubt that our ’15 here at Dishoom was full to the brim with good people, without whom we’d be nothing at all. I’m proud to be part of this; to each and every person in the Dishoom team, I want to give the warmest, sincerest thank you that I am able to summon. To every one of our kind and gracious suppliers, I give deep thanks; it’s good to be working with you. We’re also utterly grateful for the bottomless and loving patience of our families. And in the end, it is you, kind and good patrons of our livelihood, who breathe life into our work and allow us to do what we do. Thank you and thank you again for coming to Dishoom, allowing us to serve you, and coming back for more.</p>
<p>Well, it’s time for me to go home to celebrate Christmas, like a good Hindu. This year, my four year old daughter is very interested in baby Jesus and has been asking me whether he’s like baby Krishna. I’m sure I’ll figure it out by the time I get home.</p>
<p>From all of us here at Dishoom, we wish you the best for Christmas and the New Year. And from the bottom of all our hearts, we wish you the very best for ’16. It probably won’t be an easy year, but we hope it’s a good year.</p>
<p>May Ganesh-ji give you the strength to deal with the tears and the openness to make the most of the joy.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A guest blog post]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Our research for <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/introducing-dishoom-carnaby/">Dishoom Carnaby</a> took us down many unexpected avenues. We started to investigate the world of rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll Bombay in the &#8217;60s and made lots of new friends. Nissim Ezekiel, of <a href="http://thecombustiblesband.com">The Combustibles</a>, is one such friend. While we were putting together the restaurant and the <a href="http://www.dishoom.com/music/">Slip-Disc LP</a>, he kindly shared much memorabilia of the &#8216;groovy scene&#8217; in Bombay in the 60s and has now been kind enough to share his <a href="http://www.thecombustiblesband.com/2015/12/the-combustibles-on-dishooms-wall-of-fame-in-london/">blog</a> from The Combustibles&#8217; own website. </em></p>
<p>Dishoom – London’s extremely popular and highly regarded chain of restaurants modeled on the fast-vanishing Irani cafes of Bombay – opened its newest location on Kingly Street in Carnaby on October 14, 2015. As its owners explain: “When we began thinking about Dishoom Carnaby, we came across a surprising relationship that flourished in the 60s, when Western influences kicked off a rocking music scene in Bombay. We were drawn in by this cul-de-sac of history and contacted Sidharth Bhatia, author of the book ‘India Psychedelic’ as well as many of the musicians of the time.” The Combustibles are proud to have been part of this project and thrilled to have a number of the band’s images appear on Dishoom Carnaby’s Wall of Fame as we call it!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44323" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/040.jpg" alt="040" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Everett (and wife Valerie) and Lionel (with sister Ellen) attended the opening party for Dishoom Carnaby and thoroughly enjoyed being treated like celebrities again after a somewhat short hiatus of four decades or more! Enjoyed sharing the limelight with Reynold D’Silva – formerly with Brief Encounter in Bombay and now Founder/CEO of Silva Screen Records (London)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44324" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/041.jpg" alt="041" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Autograph time again??</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44322" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/039.jpg" alt="039" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ellen was always an integral part of The Combustibles experience in the good olde days – with a strong claim to have come up with the band’s name! Now, she’s again a part of the celebration in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-44329" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8V7A7421-copy.jpg" alt="8V7A7421 copy" width="682" height="478" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Bombay’s venerable Shanmukhanda Hall was the scene of many a “beat show” in the 60s and 70s including hosting the finals of the famous Simla Beat Contests. Here it’s time for “Kohinoor Beat Nite” sponsored by one of the city’s then leading textile companies. Velvette Fogg – then featuring Nissim’s cousin Nandu Bhende on vocals and brother David on bass – are also on the bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44326" src="http://www.dishoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_3530.png" alt="IMG_3530" width="540" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Not having been in Bombay during the band’s heyday, Valerie now experiences Everett’s celebrity status in London!</p>
<p>For those of our fans and friends who get the opportunity please do visit Dishoom Carnaby, enjoy the incredible food and get some photos alongside some of The Combustibles images on the ‘Wall of Fame.’ Remember to send them to us at <a href="mailto:info@thecombustiblesband.com">info@thecombustiblesband.com</a> and we’ll put them on the site!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“DON’T LIMIT A CHILD TO YOUR OWN LEARNING, FOR SHE WAS BORN IN ANOTHER TIME.”  RABINDRANATH TAGORE]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A baking hot day in early August in Bombay, not too long ago. An old Irani gentleman and his granddaughter sit in the shade of his café, underneath the least erratic fan. The little girl turns to her grandfather with a quizzical look on her face, and asks him a question….</em></p>
<p>“Dada, what is an Indian?”</p>
<p>I pause. Blink. Clear my throat. What do I tell her? Which of the many possible answers should I give to that simple, innocent question?</p>
<p>I take a moment to think. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>She looks around the café, as if it’s obvious. “Well, everyone speaks different languages, people wear different clothes, and we all eat different food… but what makes us all Indian?”</p>
<p>Rather humbly, I realise that I can’t give her a quick answer. How do you sum up a nation of one billion people (and who knows how many gods) for a child?</p>
<p>Her curiosity, however, must be nurtured; her sense of wonder and openness preserved. I must think of an answer.</p>
<p>So, I talk. I begin by telling her of the many peoples that have shaped our landscape, of the rise and fall of emperors and empresses, the religions that have waxed and waned, of the laws that have been passed. I describe the influence of the British and how their control over India made us feel robbed of our freedom and basic rights. I speak of Bapu, the father of the nation, who taught us that strength and violence were not the same thing, and taught us the need to live in harmony with one another.</p>
<p>As I delve further and deeper into the influences on being Indian, I find myself sharing my own memories of the events that have shaped our history.</p>
<p>I recall the feelings of oppression and exploitation that many felt under the Britishers, and then the relief at independence. Then it was Prime Minister Pandit Nehru that gave voice to these feelings in his declaration on 14<sup>th</sup>August 1947:</p>
<p><em>“At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”</em></p>
<p>I remember feeling overwhelming emotion – we all did. It was a time of complete change. Together, we swept away British rule and ushered in a birth of the Indian nation.</p>
<p>But I shall forever remember this time in history for its lurches between hope and dark despair. As India and Pakistan were pulled asunder by the very movements that sought to create a nation, the forging of our identity became stained with blood. My eyes moisten as the memory of hearing the horrific stories of partition comes rushing back. I stop short of telling these to my granddaughter.</p>
<p>I must not let my memory taint her innocence – at least not today. If she is seeking an answer to the question: “What is an Indian?” then I think my answer should be this: an Indian is Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bihari and Tamil; he is Hindu, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Christian and Buddhist. We are all Indian and together we are India.</p>
<p>If the hope and despair of 1947 taught me something, it is that the Indian identity is all-encompassing, and that when we allow our differences to become prejudices, to become walls that divide us, distrust and violence accumulate and we undermine the very idea of India.</p>
<p>After all this talking-talking, I ask her, gently: “So, now, beti – what do you think Indian is?”</p>
<p>And she answered: “Dada, it is us and everyone else.”</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day.</p>
<p>Come in and see us today. We’ve managed to put together a special <a href="http://playlists.net/dishoom-republic-day">patriotic playlist</a> and we’d love to buy you a nice cold Thums Up when you wish us a happy Independence Day (before 6pm). Jai hind!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[IN A WAY, ALL THAT WE ARE IS A BUNDLE OF MEMORIES.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From the moment we arrive, we accumulate our own layers of stories and experiences, remembered events and remembered emotions. Together, they become our own personal narratives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But for something so integral, so basic to who we are, memory feels so fleetingly ethereal. The fragrance of a little sponge cake (perhaps Madeleine, perhaps Mawa), the rich salty taste of butter melting on a bun dipped in hot chai, the sounds of a particular street, the soft touch of a companion’s hand, the wistful sweetness of a moment. The utterly unique moment is here, and then it’s gone. And the only trace left behind of its existence is an imperfect imprint on our minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can we preserve this memory? How can we capture a feeling or a sensation, a poignant moment, before it fades like the morning mist?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bombay’s beautiful Irani Cafés have been fading into memory for years. They once numbered a few hundred. Now only twenty-five or so remain and more seem to close with each year. These cafés which were once part of the fabric of Bombay life are fading away steadily from the collective memory of the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All who know the Irani cafés nurture treasured stories of them. They were places for bunking off school, for bashful teenage trysts, for debating politics and cinema with the idealistic bravery of youth, for escaping – deeply – into a book, accompanied by endless chai. The Irani Cafés were lovely places for growing up – and for growing old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And they were important places too. In a city all too busy making harsh social judgments, the Irani Cafés were truly shared spaces. Anyone could find refuge here for the few paise it took to buy a cup of chai &#8211; Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Parsi. The poor student, the famous artist, the tired taxi-wallah, even the hooker, shunned elsewhere. Differences leveled, tolerance a given. A city without these shared social spaces collapses into prejudice, dystopia and even violence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But sooner or later, for all the love that people have for them, the Irani Cafés may all be gone. Faded away, unnoticed, in the rush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our own small way, we thought we could contribute to the capture of memory. We already pay homage to the Irani Cafés through design and food, but we thought we could go further and document and preserve actual recollections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We gathered stories from those who know and love the Irani Cafés – guests at Dishoom, the owners of the remaining cafés, others in Bombay and London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We then literally baked these stories onto eighty of our plates (at 850C).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now – if you come to Dishoom in Shoreditch, you’ll notice stories on the plates. You can read about marriage proposals, about cantankerous owners, about rotis so good they had to be flown across continents, about double omelets and sweet chai. If you pause briefly, you may even feel a sense of how those moments – now passed forever – actually felt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed – we also invite you to look at the plates online in a <a href="http://platewallah.dishoom.com">gallery,</a> and share your own Irani café stories, if you have them. We’ll bake the best of these stories into our café in Shoreditch too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s truly our honour and privilege to be doing the important work of preserving the memory and telling the stories of the Irani Cafés of 20<sup>th</sup> century Bombay.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Martyrs’ Day is a sombre day for Indians]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <em>&#8220;If I am to die by the bullet of a mad man, I must do so smiling. There must be no anger within me. God must be in my heart and on my lips.&#8221;</em> &#8211; Mohandas K. Gandhi, 28 January 1948, two days before his assassination.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martyrs&#8217; Day marks the anniversary of the day Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (fondly known to many as Bapu) was shot down by Nathuram Godse on his way to prayers on 30th January 1948. Gandhiji will always be remembered as the father of our nation, whose life was dedicated to the nurture and service of modern India. It was Gandhi who taught us the principles of <em>ahimsa</em> and <em>satyagraha</em>, non-violence and truth; who always held firm to his beliefs and gave us hope that we could live in harmony together at a time when our country was rendered weak and fragile by the trauma of partition. His assassination, only months after <a title="Happy Independence Day" href="http://dishoom.com/happy-independence-day/">independence was declared</a>, was a devastating, heart-wrenching blow for our fledgling nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every year since then, we have commemorated his life, achievement and sacrifice on 30th January. This soon came to be a day to pay respects to others who laid down their lives for the nation. And so it became known as Martyrs&#8217; Day, and has a similar resonance amongst us Indians as Remembrance Day has for the British.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every year, a solemn and reflective remembrance ceremony takes place, starting with two minutes&#8217; silence at 11.00am. This is followed by a service during which the President of India, the vice-President, the Prime Minister and the chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force all lay wreaths at Rajghat (the memorial erected in Gandhiji&#8217;s honour, on the banks of the Yamuna in Delhi). The presence of members of the military underlines the fact that Gandhi&#8217;s sacrifice &#8211; and his principles of non-violence &#8211; are no less powerful than the sacrifice of those who physically fought for India&#8217;s freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The simple ceremony draws to a close with the sounding of the Last Post. Afterwards, the many communities and faiths of India gather for prayer services, and so are united in paying their respects to the father of the nation and other martyrs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martyrs&#8217; Day reminds us that the path to independence has not been smooth, and that human nature is such that we will always be facing forces of darkness in some form. Where there is violence and destruction, there will also be martyrs. But the day should also serve as a reminder that our strength as a nation lies in our capacity to accumulate and live with difference. India is at its greatest when we all celebrate and honour the truth of our extraordinary diversity &#8211; of language, religion, culture, values &#8211; rather than allow this truth to tear us asunder. In these troubled times, more than ever we must remember the lessons of <em>ahimsa</em> and <em>satyagraha</em> that Bapu taught us.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A GUEST BLOG POST BY MASTER STORYTELLER, VAYU NAIDU]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The great thing about dark November days is that you can actually SEE the lights – amber skies, street lights with their haloes, electric signs, and bonfires with their candle flames and smell of cinnamon.</p>
<p>The festival of Diwali is a celebration of a legend that became epic in the hands of its first author – Valmiki. There have been at least nine others and their literary Ramayanas from the 4<sup>th</sup> to the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, and other regional variations across the world.</p>
<p>Ramayana is an epic tale, and really the first novel when you think of it – since 4<sup>th</sup> century AD. But first, it was a novel that was told, spoken, sung and then it was written down. Rama was a prince with four brothers. Lakshmana was his brother, best friend and a sort of spiritual twin and they both set out early in life on an odyssey guided by a sage Vishwamitra. Rakshasa were ogre-like figures, but apart from their looks they were devious, negative fields of energy. So our epic hero’s mission was to destroy them. Rama and Lakshmana did, when they were 16, in Dandaka forest. Then Sage Viswamitra took them to a kingdom – Mithila, where a tournament was held. It was the kingdom of princess Sita – a young woman who had the spirit of fire and would challenge any injustice, and was loved by her family, friends and the kingdom for her intelligence, compassion, and beauty. Of the 500 princes who competed to lift the giant iron bow at the tournament, Rama was the one who not only lifted it, but broke it in two. He was the best suited for Sita – and so they married, but they were also in love. It wasn’t exactly “happily ever after” – and that’s what qualifies an epic as different from fairy tales! They loved each other, but more adventures were to follow, possibly to test their mettle.</p>
<p>When Rama was to be crowned King, his stepmother exiled Rama for 13 years out of the kingdom so her son Bharata could be king. Sita insisted she accompany Rama inspite of him dissuading her – there’s a wonderful village telling where an actor performing Sita says to the Rama actor in that great moment of improvisation as he pleads with her not to come: “Rama, in every Ramayana – Sita comes to the forest, if she doesn’t, there is no plot to the story!” Lakshmana insists on being their bodyguard during exile. Does Rama have a choice with two such strong-willed and loving people? The three of them set out on exile.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth year, Sita sees a ‘golden deer’. A crisis. This is a distraction that takes Rama and soon Lakshmana off the scene. A distraction by Ravana, the Emperor of the Rakshasa clan. He abducts Sita and keeps her captive in his exquisite garden Asokavan, hoping she will come to him of her own will.</p>
<p>Now comes the crux of the ethical dilemma – Rama, after months of grieving at the loss of Sita, meets Hanuman – an exiled Chief Minister of the monkey kingdom Vanara. Hanuman’s special powers enable him to find Sita, and when he asks her to return with him, she says: “Rama must fight this war of Right against Might. Ravana has tyrranised humanity long enough.”</p>
<p>This has become the central inspiration of the epic – and yes, it has championed and inspired many just causes, but we have to take exceptional care in not letting epics and its legendary characters become propagandist for chauvinistic uses – in any culture!</p>
<p>The war is fought, and now 14 years have passed. A village woman on a moonless night remembers it is time for Rama and Sita and Lakshmana to return. But she has only one diya (‘Di’ – in the Diwali) and hopes it will light their way. Soon her neighbours also start lighting their diyas, and all the streets are lit in the kingdom to welcome Rama and Sita, with Lakshmana and now Hanuman following their triumph over a dark time, and a Rakshasa’s dark reign, with light and liberty.</p>
<p>Let’s welcome Obama’s “The best is yet to come”. It’s a time for that kind of optimism that brings Light. A real triumph about getting serious about climate, economic downturn, and malicious politics. I’m remembering too, my father 90 years and still going, after he retired as an Indian Army Gurka General &#8211; Aban Naidu, who on this very day warded off an enemy air attack 70 years ago with the Allies in Burma. More stories of age and courage, and love and remembering &#8211; please!</p>
<p>Every year the story continues to be performed or retold at Ramlila or the ‘the play of Rama’s life’, in India’s 22 different languages with diverse versions to suit the terrain from  northern Punjab to southern Kanyakumari, western Gujarat, to eastern Assam – worldwide  and East Africa, and now, for the second year, here at Dishoom in London.</p>
<p>I couldn’t just stop here could I?  So as I was thinking of Sita, I thought I’d write a whole new novel titled Sita&#8217;s Ascent, about what happened to Sita after their return. Remember, she is nearly 30 now. It’s out in a few weeks from now.</p>
<p>Ever wondered why Indians didn’t write the story down in the first place? It’s about memory. Oral memory. And the sounds of words, the relish for language. At a time when people were not literate, because of their work, or indeed as women, the old stories were told, and performed so everyone heard them and knew them and passed them on by word of mouth. And in each telling and retelling of these stories they are nourished, like beautiful living things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Vayu Naidu</p>
<p><strong>Vayu is bringing to life the story of Diwali at Dishoom in two magical performances on Sunday 27th October 2013.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Vayu Naidu is a Storyteller and performer. She began her relish for language in ‘70s Bombay, from St. Xavier’s College round the corner from Irani Cafés where it all began. Her Ph.D from Unviersity of Leeds was on performing oral traditons of Ramayan and Mahabharata. As an artist and practitioner, her postdoctoral work combined art forms for storytelling with contemporary dance, world and western music both classical and contemporary, and digital arts. She now writes and trains and is setting up VISTA, a storytelling academy.</p>
<p>Her new novel titled &#8216;Sita&#8217;s Ascent&#8217; is out now.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[BEFORE I MOVED TO LONDON I WAS TOLD OFTEN HOW SIMILAR IT IS TO BOMBAY.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Locations made familiar in Bollywood films, Victoria carriages, a melting pot of communities&#8230; and for the days I felt homesick I had Wembley, Southall and Brick Lane. They said I would feel right at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I especially resisted Shoreditch for years. A lot of that had to do with constant invitations to test how authentic the &#8220;curry&#8221; is. And some had to do with the city&#8217;s coolerati constantly trying to put Shoreditch in a box (that it always triumphantly wriggled out of).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then three years ago, the day I stopped feeling homesick, I set out for Brick Lane. I braced myself for the assault of sweet shops, Bangladeshi curry smells and filthy streets, and instead lost my way to Arnold Circus. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the monsoon-like July afternoon or the sudden quiet that surrounded me, but for my first few minutes in Shoreditch I thought I was in Bombay&#8217;s Horniman Circle Gardens. I felt right at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In that instant I was back in the Bombay of 1992, walking through Horniman Circle to Cafe Mocambo, for my first ever chai at my first ever Irani Cafe, for my first ever date. I remember sitting on a bench in the little garden and asking Bombay to help settle my nerves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This garden in South Bombay really should not be the sanctuary it is&#8230; the Bombay Stock Exchange is a stone&#8217;s throw away, the city&#8217;s Mint isn&#8217;t far either, and one of Bombay&#8217;s busiest business districts &#8211; Fort/Fountain &#8211; kisses the edge of the gardens. And yet the labyrinth of streets that surround Horniman Circle are like caravans of calm, guiding weary visitors to hidden gems like Bombay Paperie, Cafe Mocambo, Jimmy Boy and Apoorva. Is the quiet out of reverence for the imposing Asiatic Library whose brilliant white steps lead into Horniman Circle? Or does Bombay herself need to stop for chai in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since that day, Arnold Circus has represented all that Horniman Circle does for me. A space to escape from the Suits, the clatter of Brick Lane, and the skyscrapers of the City. Lazy afternoons of ambling around the cafes and stores that weave their protective net around Arnold Circus have found a permanent place on my Greatest Hits of Memories playlist, that I often replay in my mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so London became what Bombay is. Both are cities you can get lost in to never be found; and yet find yourself over and over again. These are cities where destiny, loss and love are just round the corner. Maximum cities where anything is possible. Everything is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Thums Ups at Café Mocambo to Thums Up Flips at <a title="Shoreditch" href="http://dishoom.com/shoreditch/">Dishoom Shoreditch</a>, life seems to have started all over again. Thank you, Dishoom.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">BURA NA MANO, HOLI HAI!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(Or for the non-Desis amongst us,<em> &#8216;Don&#8217;t get offended, it&#8217;s Holi!&#8217;</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s nothing quite like Holi. Literally, you have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All over India, hordes of ordinary people seem to lose their collective minds, abandon all sense of decorum and go a bit wild on the streets, chasing and pelting each other with <em>gulal </em>(coloured powders). As the vibrant powders are unleashed on enthusiastic – or unsuspecting – revellers, social boundaries are blurred with colour and for that one crazy day, anything goes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Holi festival comes around on the day after the full moon each March. Its roots lie in a Hindu legend, in which the wicked Holika, the sister of the demon Hiranyakashaypu, meets her demise in a blazing fire, and the good child Prahalad escapes unharmed. Holi celebrates this triumph of good over evil, the power of Prahalad&#8217;s faith, and it heralds the end of winter, spring’s grateful rebirth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has also become a chance (or more accurately, an excuse!) for Indians to shed their tightly-held inhibitions. The usual social strictures are delightfully subverted, leaving us free to indulge in feverish colour-play and light-hearted merrymaking. The fact that <em>bhang </em>(cannabis) is traditionally consumed at Holi, in thandai, lassi or pakoras, only casts a happy glow over  the playful nature of proceedings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It could only be Holi when an employee dumps a bucket of coloured powder over his most senior colleague without fear of recrimination. Or when a usually conservative <em>maasi </em>(aunty) ends up soaked to the skin with dye, or when a younger brother flirts outrageously with his <em>bhabhi (</em>sister-in-law). Who can forget the scene in Vikram Seth’s ‘A Suitable Boy’, in which Maan – high on bhang – gently terrorises his <em>bhabhi</em> and dunks a college professor in a bathtub of pink liquid? Magical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And by breaking down these social boundaries, Holi also brings us all together, regardless of caste, religion or social status. It’s a chance for us to forgive past transgressions and extend the hand of peace; a day of chaos and joyful, exuberant mess that can somehow wipe the slate clean.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year<strong>*</strong> at Dishoom, we wanted to celebrate this slightly barmy, fun-filled festival of Holi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, we had to figure out the practicalities of doing Holi over here – what with <em>bhang</em> not being that legal, and the lack of open space to play colours in (we definitely didn’t like the idea of a cleaning bill from Westminster Council). But in our own way, we’re bringing Holi to London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From next week, we’ll be decorating Dishoom with brightly coloured kites and Holi bunting, and colourful chalk Holi colours will adorn the pavement outside (we thought it would be fun to do a rangoli at Holi!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ll be serving a Holi menu and a selection of specially created Holi drinks, including a ‘Naughty Holi Lassi’, served with rum and generous helpings of our version of <em>gulal</em> – flavoured sugar-powders that you add and mix to your flavour and colour taste. Or go for the Bhang Lassi – with rum instead of <em>bhang</em> – if you want to keep it traditional (without breaking the law!). And our special HoliBollybellini is a Bollybellini with a twist – the addition of colourful spherified Bollybellini pearls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then on Thursday 8<sup>th </sup>and Friday 9<sup>th</sup> March – the days the celebrations really kick off in India – our staff will be given the Holi treatment (that means they’ll be welcoming you covered in traditional coloured powders!) And of course, we’ll be serving traditional <em>mithai </em>to all our guests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s also some cool (passworded) Holi freebies on their way so keep an eye out for these on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/dishoomlondon">Facebook</a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/dishoomlondon">Twitter</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So – we very much look forward to celebrating Holi with you here in London, and wish you a very happy Holi!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS. Who knows? Next year we might find a way to actually play Holi in London. Interested? Let us know below!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>* This information was published for our 2012 Holi celebrations. In 2013, we actually held a <a title="Play Holi with Dishoom" href="http://dishoom.com/play-holi-with-dishoom/">proper Holi party</a> and then in 2014 we made it <a title="Our Holi party 2014" href="http://dishoom.com/our-holi-party-2014/">even bigger and better</a>&#8230;</em></strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[A TALE OF BRAVERY, OF DARING, OF WONDER...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Diwali draws near again, and with it fireworks, colour and celebrations. But it&#8217;s also worth remembering the narrative of Diwali, passed lovingly on from generation to generation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The noble prince gives up the throne, his birthright, and leaves with his wife and brother for the forest to honour the aged king&#8217;s promise. The princess is kidnapped by a fearsome ten-headed king, the ruler of a splendid southern island. The noble prince meets the loyal monkey god. Together they build an army and a bridge of stones to the island, whence they join valiant battle with demons to rescue the princess. They return triumphantly home, and the prince takes his rightful place as king. Darkness banished, noble prince in his rightful place, tyrannical ten-headed monarch vanquished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a tale of dangerous sorceresses who disguise themselves as beautiful seductresses. Of enchanting shape-shifting golden deer and brave vultures, of chariots flying across the sky. Of the monkey god leaping the ocean, plucking the sun from its place and holding it in his armpit. Of a demon who sleeps for months, and wakes up ravenous for flesh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also a tale of duty. Of placing faithfulness to one&#8217;s ideals above personal gain. About serving one&#8217;s parents. A tale of patient, loyal service through both the depths of despair and the heights of triumph.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Diwali is about all these things. For Hindus, it marks the vanquishing of evil, the return of the prince, Lord Rama, after years in the forest. When Lord Rama came back to Ayodhya, little diyas &#8211; or earthen candles &#8211; were lit. We continue this tradition today, with its symbolism of <a title="It’s Diwali (again!)" href="http://dishoom.com/its-diwali-again/" target="_blank">awakening, new joy and hope, the beginning of a new year </a>&#8211; an important time to be with family and loved ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year at Dishoom, we decided to delve more deeply into Diwali, its traditions and stories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On <strong>Sunday 23rd October</strong>, starting in the morning we have a fantastic day of events (in association with the South Asian Literature Festival) to celebrate the Diwali story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adults and children alike will be spellbound by the incredible storyteller Vayu Naidu &#8211; who will narrate the story of Diwali in <strong>two magical story-telling performances at 11.30am and 3pm</strong>. Vayu will use her mastery of the art of storytelling to bring to life Rama and Sita, and tell how Hanuman the wise flying monkey brings peace, light and delight to the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, kids (and adults!) can <strong>delight in having their faces painted as a colourful character from the Diwali story</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The budding artists amongst you can also help our resident art-wallah, Dameon Priestly, <strong>create a Diwali Rangoli on the pavement outside Dishoom</strong>, while we keep kids warm with Junior Chai (delicious frothy milk, cinnamon and honey).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the evening &#8211; at 6pm, we&#8217;ll be showing the <strong>mesmerising, funny and beautiful animated film, <a href="http://sitasingstheblues.com/" target="_blank">Sita Sings the Blues</a></strong>. The award-winning film narrates and gently questions the Diwali story. It&#8217;s brilliant. Come and relax with a drink and some snacks and enjoy the show.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, for the whole of Diwali period from Tuesday 18th October &#8211; Sunday 30th October, we&#8217;re doing two <strong>special Diwali Feasts</strong>, one completely vegetarian and the other featuring our much-loved Dishoom lobster tail. By popular demand, we&#8217;ve brought back the Dahi Puri and the Phaldari Kofta Ruby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So &#8211; we very much look forward to seeing you over Diwali and wishing you much prosperity and light over the coming new year!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sunday 23rd October &#8211; Diwali at Dishoom</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11am &#8211; 1pm</strong> &#8211; Pavement chalk Rangoli for kids and adults of all ages, with artist Dameon Priestly<br />
(We&#8217;ll bring you lashings of Junior Chai to keep you warm!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11am onwards</strong> &#8211; Face-painting for kids and adults of all ages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11.30am and 3pm</strong> <a href="http://www.vayunaiducompany.org.uk/" target="_blank">Vayu Naidu</a>, storyteller extraordinaire tells the story of Diwali, princes, princesses and monkey gods! (roughly 45 mins)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6pm &#8211; </strong>Screening of Sita Sings the Blues with drinks and snacks</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A time for reflection]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We often find it too easy to hurtle through the days, in an attempt to <span id="GRmark_8ea0cfe9cafb60f8e2e78f9ba3f310cb12a10e5d_outpace:0" class="GRcorrect">outpace</span> the bustling city &#8211; be it London or Bombay &#8211; which always seems to be running away like a steam-engine train on a rickety track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Occasionally, it does us good to pause for thought, to disembark the carriage and sit on the platform awhile. The last few weeks have seen millions of Muslims across India and around the world, from Bombay to London, take the time to reflect, pray and taste the essence of a simpler life. In observing the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, our Muslim brothers and sisters refrain from eating and drinking during daylight hours, devote time to prayer and to the giving of alms. In Islam, Ramadan holds special significance as the month when the first chapters of the holy Qur&#8217;an were first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The morning starts early, too early, when healthy adult Muslims wake and make their way downstairs. First, some eggs, toast or some porridge, perhaps, and always plenty of water to nourish and sustain for the day ahead. Then, recite the morning prayers. The day may be altogether routine: filled with meetings and laughter, emails and quizzical expressions, with small breaks for prayer. But when it is time to return home, when the sun begins to set, the family gathers together. With the bite of a juicy date, that first sip of water upon parched lips, with family and friends and loved ones, the fast is broken and it is time to remember the things that matter. In Hyderabad they eat the traditional Ramadan dish of Haleem – a thick, smooth stew of <span id="GRmark_7ef47aa183bcd296cca7e957d662b54354bf0e96_pounded:0" class="GRcorrect">pounded</span> wheat, lentils and lamb, cooked for many hours and spiced delicately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The culmination of Ramadan in a week or so will bring with it a day of festivity known as Eid-<span id="GRmark_21b33622d2aea8b988f7784b0d61833a6c426046_Ul:0" class="GRcorrect">Ul</span>-Fitr. Following a communal prayer, Muslims take time to visit extended friends and family, give children gifts of money known as ‘Eidie’. A three-day-long affair in many Muslim countries, new clothes are tailor-made, planned for many weeks in advance. A time to enjoy one another&#8217;s company after a month of relative austerity, Eid is a cherished and celebratory affair. Veritable feasts are held and the food is rich &#8211; Biryani, rich with saffron, Nihari, steaming with <span id="GRmark_3c6012e816cd4e45d86026a1cfb2c8bda5a9ecd5_chillis:0" class="GRcorrect">chillis</span>. And of course, Haleem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the spirit of reflection, of getting off the train and sitting on the platform awhile, we have some dates set aside for those who are fasting to break their fast (just ask!) We will also have a small amount of Haleem every day as a special this week. We&#8217;re also doing a special Eid Feast next week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And good luck with the rest of the fasting!</p>
