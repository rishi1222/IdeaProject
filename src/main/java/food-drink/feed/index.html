		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Dishoom &#8211; for all you authentic Indian cuisine lovers, this one&#8217;s for you. Something worth noting though, is that they do NOT take reservations and it is one of the hottest restaurants in London at the moment, so be expected to wait awhile. I waited in line for an hour and forty-five minutes&#8230; I&#8217;m not a very patient person, so I was pretty irritated by the time I sat down to eat, but the food is delicious! We ordered the Pau Bhaji to start &#8211; this actually didn&#8217;t sound good to me when reading the menu description, but our server said it was their most popular appetizer, so we went for it! This was my favorite thing from the meal. It&#8217;s basically spicy mashed up vegetables served with hot buns to spread it on. SO GOOD. I would recommend doing this on a night you are planning to eat earlier, around 6 &#8211; get there at 5:30pm and you should be good! [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Becky is from Oxford, England and went to school for German and Greek language, so she studied abroad in Thessaloniki at the same time. I think me and Becky became friends the first minute we met. She is hilarious and one of the easiest people to talk to I&#8217;ve ever met. She is now an actress in London. Last year when I went to London for my honeymoon we met up with Kristin and Becks and had the best time &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t wait to see them again on this trip! We did a little planning and met at a restaurant we had all heard good things about &#8211; Dishoom. [&#8230;]]]></description>
