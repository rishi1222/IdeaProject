		<description><![CDATA[Hi Martin - thanks for your comment. I completely understand your concern.  

All of our lamb and chicken is Halal and is sourced from HFA-certified suppliers. The only place on our menu where we serve sausages and bacon is on our breakfast menu and we are incredibly careful about stripping out all the equipment we use to prepare these items and ensuring that it is thoroughly cleaned and stored separately before we serve lunch and dinner. All breakfast meats are contained and stored separately to our other food. 

Many of our chefs strictly only eat Halal - so they are very conscientious in making sure all of this is observed.

Dishoom is very diverse - we are a team of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and people of many other faiths. We throw events for Holi, Christmas, Diwali and Eid. We work hard to make Dishoom a place where all are welcomed with warmth, and differences are celebrated rather than judged.

Hope that helps - and look forward to seeing you soon!]]></description>
