		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] [Dishoom]Dishoom&#8217;s cheese toast is probably the best thing that&#8217;s ever come out of fusion cooking. Yup. That&#8217;s a pretty big claim. This Bombay-style restaurant lays on the cheddar thick and the green chillis even thicker. And its breakfast counterpart, Kejriwal, where the chilli cheese is then topped with two fried eggs, is nothing short of an early-morning miracle. They&#8217;ve got two other branches in Covent Garden and Kings Cross too, meaning you&#8217;re never too far from the melted stuff. Just how it should be. [&#8230;]]]></description>
