		<description><![CDATA[Very true, Fans, hanging wires , table tops , chai all reminds me of Bombay cafes

I am very impressed with Aks comments and willingness to do something for corporates for their benefit, mot many people have this intention, at-least in todays world and that too in a super busy city like London 

Well done Aks and Dishoom]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I visited Dishoom with my family on Friday evening last week.  It was a journey that was emotional, enjoyable and cravable, well done!  You have picked the best of what Bombay food has to offer, packaged it in a way which makes the food easy to access and wrapped an amazing experience around it. Kiran our waitress was an incredible host and an outstanding sales person...a real credit to you and your team.

The fans, hanging wires, table tops, chai glasses, bollywood posters, choice of music etc was all adding to the experience.  My wife was in tears by the end of the meal...reliving our days in Bombay and cherishing our experience at Dishoom.

All my very best to you and my congratulations for an incredibly well put together concept.  May you grow and prosper!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Madam/Sir 


I visited your restuarant yesterday just by chance and was very much impressed by the concept  and layout. Three Cheers Dishoom!

I think your restaurant has great scope to grow but havent seen much of marketing to advertise this great concept and take it to a different level 

I work as Strategic Marketing Head in London and would like to offer my professional service free to Disoom. 

You must be thinking why should somebody do it for free ?

 I a Bombayite (by heart ) feel that we owe a lot to Iranian/ Persian Community to build Bombay, which we are proud of today. My heart cries to see the Iranian cafes which was once upon a time the pride of Bombay are disappearing and our new generation will not be able to enjoy the unique experience of dining at these cafes in Bombay 

I would be honoured if I could share some of my marketing strategies to make your project atleast Big enough in London. ( you may not even need my services but I thought, I should atleast offer) 

Next time I go to Mumbai in December, I would try to meet the owner of atleast one such heritage cafe to discuss how it could be revived in Bombay ( sorry for me it is still Bombay not Mumbai) 

Warm Regards
Aks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice food, nice website. But one BIG problem:  Everyone wants to know more about &quot;Iranis&quot;. 

You only briefly define what an &quot;Irani cafe&quot; is on your website. But you decline to define Iranis as anything other than &quot;Persian immigrants&quot;.  This denies your customers from understanding who Iranis are, and why their Mumbai cafes are the multicultural food and social havens they are. Why your fear?

Indian &quot;Iranis&quot; are actually Iranian Zoroastrian immigrants from the early 20th century. They left a nation incredibly intolerant to religious minorities (the irony being that Zoroastrianism was for many centuries the dominant religion throughout ancient Persia and beyond).  In Mumbai, they joined the Parsi people, their Zoroastrian brethren who&#039;d already found refuge in India more than 1000 years ago. The Iranis religion is very important to them. Why are you afraid to mention their religion? 

I&#039;ve searched many citations for your lovely cafe, and it&#039;s clear that your pr materials as well as your website are afraid to mention the religion of the Indian Iranis.  I beleive also that Dishoom is lovingly recreated by non-Iranis -- nothing wrong with that, but something else you also seem fearful to admit. Why not be open and honest? 

One Mumbai Irani cafe is famous for it&#039;s paintings of religious figures, including Zarathustra, on their mirrors -- a charming touch of the multiculturalism that is Mumbai. 

Your omission of these vital facts about the Mumbai Irani community, as well as your own personal backgrounds (whatever those may be), is denying your customers the ability to truly appreciate the multicultural ethos that all Irani cafes evoke. In multicultural London, this lack of identity-savvy is very out of place.]]></description>
