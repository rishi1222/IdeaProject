		<description><![CDATA[I love Holi! It&#039;s my favourite festival (bit biased as I was born on Holi) and its colours always bring joy. If you&#039;re keen for organising a mass Holi in London without worrying about cleaning up, what about in a public park? If it&#039;s just coloured water, surely it wouldn&#039;t be a big deal? You could have suburban teams or boys v girls to get everyone going.

Looking fwd to revisiting Bombay via your wonderful cafe very soon :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great idea! I&#039;ve attended Holi many times in India and wish we would celebrate it here! 

Could you please tell me who took the wonderful photograph? It&#039;s a shame not to see a credit on it!

Thank you!

See you on the 8th.
