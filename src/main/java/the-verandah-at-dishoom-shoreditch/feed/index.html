		<description><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to arrange a baby shower and am expecting about 20-25 guests. I have been to your Shoreditch branch.. and was hoping to arrange the same either in the Varanda or in kings cross centre. Is this something you arrange ? and if yes what sort of budget is expected per head ? 

ps: I wrote to your reservations mail id as well.]]></description>
