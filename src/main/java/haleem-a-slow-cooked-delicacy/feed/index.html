		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ali - this has now been changed to Prawn Moilee as the Covent Garden special. (King&#039;s Cross special is Nihari, Shoreditch special is Lamb Raan.) We may bring it back e.g. as an Eid special though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Syed - thanks for your comment. I completely understand your concern. All of our lamb and chicken is Halal and is sourced from HFA-certified suppliers. The only place on our menu where we serve sausages and bacon is on our breakfast menu and we are incredibly careful about stripping out all the equipment we use to prepare these items and ensuring that it is thoroughly cleaned and stored separately before we serve lunch and dinner. All breakfast meats are contained and stored separately to our other food. Many of our chefs strictly only eat Halal - so they are very conscientious in making sure all of this is observed. I hope this has helped to ease your concerns - and we look forward to seeing you soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We went for lunch last Saturday in your Covent garden location. We are regular visitors, but I was shocked to discover that you have taken the haleem off the menu despite it still being on the paper menu! That is the main reason I go to Dishoom. Could you please bring it back as it is delicious!]]></description>
