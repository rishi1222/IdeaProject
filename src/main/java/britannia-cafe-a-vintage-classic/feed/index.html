		<description><![CDATA[i was very fortunate to have had the opportunity to dine in this bombay cafe. i was treated by my lovely cousin (Grishma) who lives in Bombay. i was amazed how busy the place was and how great the ambiance was inside the restuarant. the roads outside were also busy as usual as we sat near to the front door where a dog was lying down near the entrance. we were greeted by the great man himself Boman Kohinoor who spoke wonderfully clear english. he even offered to show us pictures taken inside his cafe with the late Princess Diana. i must also mention the serviced office was second to none. my cousin insisted i try the berry pulao which i agreed to sample. to this date i have never tried a more mouth watering dish. the owner also suggested i compliment the meal with some fresh lemondade (nimu Pani) which went down as a treat. 

this was 1 of my best experiences in bombay of an indian cafe and i really hope this resturant exists for years to come and hope to visit it and the owner again very soon]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fear among a number of Mumbaikers I ve spoken to is that the restaurant itself will end up as a distant metmory that Britannia may close. Then there s the sali boti and Britannia s squishy chapattis and Pallonji s ginger or cherry soda and the Bombay duck battered fish none of which would mean a thing were it not for Britannia s consistency.]]></description>
