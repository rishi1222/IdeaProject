		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s BRILLIANT that you are providing a special menu for Ramadan and to celebrate Eid. And how considerate that you are providing dates and using halal meat. I&#039;m actually touched. What a lovely gesture!!

I look forward to my next visit to what is a fantastic restaurant. Your chai is amazing!! :)

Thank you on behalf of the Muslim population. Can&#039;t wait to taste Haleem. ;)]]></description>
