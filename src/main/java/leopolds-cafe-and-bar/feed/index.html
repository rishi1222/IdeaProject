		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE LOVE LOVE Leopolds. Last year when I visited Bombay for the first time I said this is the only place I HAD TO visit, and it was such a treat - such an authentic cafe and I felt like part of the Shantaram gang sat in there!

Lovely review of Leopolds x]]></description>
